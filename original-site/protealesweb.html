<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The approximate age for this node is 191 m.y. (Wu et al. 2014) or only 130.3 m.y.o. (Magall&oacute;n et al. 2015). In many phylogenies Sabiaceae are adjacent to other members of the order along the eudicot spine, but whatever the topology, ages are rather younger. Estimates for a topology [Proteales [Sabiales [Buxales...]]] range from (143-)129, 126(-116) m.y. (Bell et al. 2010 for details), while Xue et al. (2012) estimate (126.4-)121.4(-110.2) m.y., Naumann et al. (2013) around 124.8 m.y., and Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013) about 121.5 m. years. Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2001) estimated (150-)144-130(-124) m.y. for the stem <i>Nelumbo</i>, etc., clade and (145-)140, 128(-123) m.y. for stem-group Sabiaceae; Anderson et al. (2005) dated stem group Sabiaceae to 122-118 m.y.a., and it would be slightly older than the stem <i>Nelumbo</i>, etc., clade; Tank et al. (2015: Table S1) dated this clade to around 131.4 m.y.a, while around 144-140 m.y.o. was the estimate in Zeng et al. (2017).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Endress (2011a) suggested that syncarpy might be a key innovation somewhere around here; optimization on the tree is not easy. Positioning of other apomorphies is also difficult.  Although the androecial feature "stamens numerous, but then usually fasciculate and/or centrifugal" is placed at the [Rosids et al. + Asterids et al.] / Pentapetalae node, there is no particular reason why it should not be placed here.  If <i>CRABSCLAW</i> expression is found in the nectaries of Sabiaceae and Proteaceae, this, to could be placed at this node (and it would also be interesting to look at what is going on in Buxaceae, too); along the same lines, sucrose synthesis and secretion is similar in the floral nectaries of the Brassicaceae and Solanaceae examined, which are extrastaminal and gynoecial nectaries respectively (Lin et al. 2014). See also the <a href="dillenialesweb.html#RosAstetal" target="home">Pentapetalae</a> page.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For the distinction between gynoecial (supposedly asterids only) and receptacular nectaries, see Smets (1988), Smets et al. (2003) and Erbar (2014: the two not always easy to distinguish); for a general survey of nectaries, see also Bernadello (2007). Nectary vascularization  can vary between quite closely related taxa (e.g. Saxena 1973; de Paula et al. 2011).</p>

Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b>  Anderson et al. (2005) date crown group Sabiaceae at 119-91 m.y.a.; (135-)129, 114(-108) m.y. is the figure in Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2001).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fossils identified as Sabiaceae are known from the Cretaceous-Cenomanian ca 98 m.y.a. (<i>Insitiocarpus</i>, c.f. <i>Meliosma</i>) and -Turonian (<i>Sabia</i>) of Europe (Knobloch &amp; Mai 1986; Friis et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Synonymy: <b>Meliosmaceae</b> Meisner, <b>Wellingtoniaceae</b> Meisner</p>

<ul><li>Sabiaceae are evergreen trees or lianes that may be recognised by the brochidodromous
venation of their leaves or leaflets, their small flowers with the perianth
whorls and stamens all opposite, and the more or less flattened and distinctly
curved drupelets; the surface of the latter is often venose.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b>  <u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Most species of <i>Meliosma</i> have explosively dehiscent anthers that are held under tension by the complex staminodes, but there is also a kind of secondary pollination presentation in which pollen collects on the broad connective between the anthers sacs (Ronse De Craene &amp; Wanntorp 2008 and Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga 2015 for discussion; Ronse De Craene et al. (2015b) suggested that there was similar anther dehiscence in <i>Sabia</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Sabiaceae are distinctive among members of the eudicot grade in that the perianth is differentiated into a calyx and corolla
(Drinnan et al. 1994; Hoot et al. 1999) and there is a nectary that appears to be axial/receptacular (see Erbar 2014). However, the interpretation of the flower of <i>Meliosma</i>, especially of the nature of the perianth
members, is difficult. Two sepals are smaller than the others and have been called
bracteoles, as by Endress (2010c), who would then interpret the flower as being basically monosymmetric and trimerous, and the calyx whorl and the two whorls of both corolla and androecium as all alternating (one member of each is reduced). Others, e.g.  Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga (2015), incline to thinking of the flower as being 5-merous. According to Baillon (1874), the two carpels of <i>Sabia</i> are median; Warburg (1896) drew the two carpels of <i>Meliosma</i> as being oblique to the vertical axis of the flowers, but
median to the plane between the two bracteoles; van Beusekom and van der Water
(1989) show the carpels as being oblique both to the vertical axis and to the
plane between the bracteoles, and the flower could be called obliquely
monosymmetric. Wanntorp and Ronse de Craene (2007) illustrate the carpels as being more or less collateral, and Ronse  de Craene (2010) as slightly oblique, bracteoles are not shown, but their position is described as being variable. Ronse De Craene et al. (2015a) note substantial differences in the floral development of the two species of <i>Sabia</i> they examined that they suggest is connected to the incorporation of a bracteole into the flower in <i>S. japonica</i> as a "sepal". See also Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga (2015) for more discussion.</p>

(2012) ages of (122.8-)109.3(-75.2[- 16.3 m.y.!]) m.y., almost the age of fossils reliably assigned to Nelumbonaceae, Anderson et al. (2005) date this node to around 121-115 m.y.a. and Tank et al. (2015: Table S2) to about 119.8 m.y. ago. Magall&oacute;n and Castillo (2009) and Magall&oacute;n et al. (2015) suggest an age of around 117 m.y., Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013) an age of around 105 m.y. and Xue et al. (2012) ages of (123.8-)ca 109(-16.3) m.y.; ca 121.7-119.2 m.y. is the age in  Sauquet et al. (2009b), a low ca 82.6 m.y. in Naumann et al. (2013) and a high ca 177 m.y.a. in Z. Wu et al. (2014).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The oldest fossils of this clade (Nelumbonaceae, <i>Nelumbites</i> are around 107-99.6 m.y.a. (Upchurch &amp; Wolfe 2005; see also Doyle &amp; Endress 2010; Friis et al. 2011).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Barthlott et al. (1996) noted that the cuticle waxes of Platanaceae
and Nelumbonaceae were very different. However, Hayes et al. (2000) emphasised that there were only two sepals in <i>Nelumbo</i>, so the [Nelumbonaceae [Platanaceae + Proteaceae]] clade could be characterised as having dimerous flowers
(see Doyle &amp; Endress 2000 for Proteaceae). However, fossils assignable to Platanaceae are very variable in their floral morphologies, and some seem to have much more conventional, almost core eudicot-like flowers (von Balthazar &amp; Sch&ouml;nenberger 2009). Fossils like <i>Exnelumbites</i>, from Late Cretaceous Mexico, have chloranthoid leaf teeth, that is, teeth with a glandular apex, a vein proceeding to the apex and joined by branches from above and below (Estrada-Ruiz et al. 2011). In the platanoid teeth of <i>Platanus</i>
 higher order veins approach but do not enter the apex, and so they are perhaps not so different from chloranthoid teeth (Doyle 2007; Estrada-Ruiz et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Crown-group Nelumbonaceae may be (6.5-)1.6(-0.1) m.y.o. (Xue et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fossil Nelumbonaceae, as <i>Nelumbites</i>, the leaves with rather different venation but the flowers with the distinctive expanded floral receptacle of extant <i>Nelumbo</i>, are reported from the mid to late Albian (late Lower Cretaceous) ca 107-99.6 m.y.a. (Upchurch &amp; Wolfe 2005; see also Doyle &amp; Endress 2010; Friis et al. 2011; Doyle &amp; Upchurch 2014).</p>

<ul><li>Nelumbonaceae are water plants that are easily
recognised by their peltate leaves that are held
above the water surface like parasols; the main venation is dichotomous. The broken ends of pedicels or petioles remain attached by thin, spiralling strands of congealed latex. Their flowers are somewhat like those
of water lilies but have separate spherical carpels immersed in a large, obconical
receptacle.</p>

<p>Floral formula: * K 2, 4; C 10<; A many; <u>G 10-30<</u>.</ul></li>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  Fossils of Nelumbonaceae - leaves and fruits, although not connected - are known from southern Argentina in late Upper Cretaceous rocks of Campanian-Maastrichtian age (Gandolfo &amp; Cuneo 2005). Other fossils are discussed by Estrada-Ruiz et al. (2011) and Friis et al. (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Given the great age of the clade, 100 m.y. or substantially more, <i>Nelumbo</i> has been called a living fossil, at least from the molecular point of view, and it also shows considerable morphological stasis (Sanderson &amp; Doyle 2001; Xue et al. 2012).</b> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Vogel (2004a) provided a fascinating account of air circulation in <i>Nelumbo</i>, i.a. suggesting the air flows in different halves of the leaf in different directions, similarly in the petiole, and that air may move down one petiole and then up another two nodes behind on the stem (see also Matthews &amp; Seymour 2006). The central disc has many stomata and is the site of air exchange for the petiolar canals (see also Estrada-Ruiz et al. 2011); if covered by water, air from the petiolar canals bubbles up through it. This circulation probably supplies the submersed roots and rhizomes with oxygen (c.f. Armstrong &amp; Armstrong 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> The flowers are thermogenic, starch breaking down in the expanded receptacle, and halictid bees and especially chrysomelid bettles are the likely pollinators (Vogel &amp; Hadacek 2004; Watling et al. 2006; Li &amp; Huang 2009; Dieringer et al. 2014). The progamic phase, the time between pollination and fertilization, is notably short, as in at least some other aquatic angiosperms (including <i>Nymphaea</i>:  see Williams et al. 2010). The sharply pointed and often six-rayed epidermal druses on the surface of the receptacle may protect it against herbivores (Vogel 2004b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Lotus fruits are noted for their longevity, and fruits 1350 &plusmn; 220 yrs old have been germinated (Shen-Miller et al. 1995). This may be connected with the chemical composition of the fruit wall which is distinctive in its high polysaccharide (galactose, mannose) and tannin content, compared to the lignin + cellulose composition of (e.g.) the seed coat of Nymphaeaceae (ven Bergen et al. 1997).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> For the chloroplast genome of <i>Nelumbo</i>, see Z. Wu et al. (2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Understanding how <i>Nelumbo</i> grows is difficult. The cataphylls more or less surround the stem and presumably represent the stipular portion of the leaf. Axillary branches show the same arrangement of leaves as described above, but with the addition of the prophyll which is on the same side of the branch as the first cataphyll. Flower buds develop in the axis of the second cataphyll, axillary branches in the axil of the expanded leaf, however, other interpretations are also possible. The sheathing stipule associated with the foliage leaf is open on the side of the stem
opposite to the leaf insertion. For some literature on the growth pattern of <i>Nelumbo</i>, see Eichler (1878), Wignand and Dennert (1888), Miki (1926), and Esau and Kosakai (1975).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Vessels arise first in the roots, but are also found in the rhizome, and the trend of their specialisation is similar; this
is the monocot pattern. Details of the root cortex of Nelumbonaceae differ considerably from those in Nymphaeales (Seago 2002). Although the vascular bundles are scattered in the stem, they are inside an endodermis.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Hayes et al. (2000) noted that the two sepals are inserted in the vertical plane; Moseley and Uhl (1985) found that there may be four, decussating sepals. Although the floral vasculature is complex because of the presence of rings of cortical bundles, the vascularization of individual parts of the flower is undistinguished; the sepals may, however, have but a single trace that quickly divides (Moseley &amp; Uhl 1985). The stamens develop from an androecial ring, and they and the carpels may be irregularly whorled (Hayes et al. 2000). Cronquist (1981) described the stamens as being introrse-latrose; Endress
(1995) as extrorse, Takhtajan (1997) as extrorse (the outer members) and
introrse (the others). There is also disagreement over endosperm development which has been variously described as
nuclear, cellular, or helobial, and over pollen morphology (Kreunen &amp; Osborne 1999).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some general information
is taken from Williamson and Schneider (1993) and Hayes et al. (2000), for chemistry, see Hegnauer (1969, 1990: as Nymphaeaceae), for stamens, see Moseley (1958), and for embryology, etc., see Cook (1909), Khanna (1965) and Batygina et al. (1982).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> In the past, Nelumbonaceae were usually associated with Nymphaeaceae (e.g. Cronquist 1981), the two having superficially similar flowers and vegetative body (both are "water lilies") - and it turns out that floral gene expression patterns in <i>Nymphaea</i> and <i>Nelumbo</i> are remarkably similar (Yoo et al. 2010). Takhtajan (1997) removed Nelumbonaceae from Nymphaeales, but placed them alone in his subclass Nelumbonidae. Both the morphology of the cuticle waxes and plant chemistry suggest a relationship with Ranunculales, but there
the waxes are nonacosan-10-ol rather than 4-10- or 5-10-diol (Barthlott et al.
1996, 2003: the difference not emphasised). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> <i>Platanocarpus</i> (most = <i>Friisicarpus</i>) is known fossil from the Lower Cretaceous 113-98 m.y.a. (Crane et al. 1993), and other fossils are associated with Platanaceae in the constrained morphological analysis of Doyle and Endress (2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  That Platanaceae and Proteaceae are sister taxa may explain why there are so many leaf fossils from the southern hemisphere that are &quot;platanoid&quot; in their general aspect (K. Johnason, in Drinnan et al. 1994; Hoot et al. 1999).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The wood anatomy of Proteaceae and Platanaceae is very different, perhaps because of the different climatic conditions under which the two grow (Baas et al. 2003); however, they both have broad rays, and the former have concave vessel-parenchyma festoons and the latter concave growth ring boundaries. For stomatal morphology, see Carpenter et al. (2005). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although flowers of Platanaceae and Proteaceae look very different, von Balthazar and Sch&ouml;nenberger (2009; see also Ronse De Craene 2015b) suggest similarities; both consist of perianth, stamens, and fleshy structures. In Platanaceae the latter may represent an outer staminal whorl, in Proteaceae an inner whorl. This hypothesis needs further study, but if the difference in their positions are confirmed they are unlikely to be an apomorphy at this level.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age. </b>Fossils with the distinctive petiole bases of subgenus <i>Platanus</i> are abundant in the Palaeocene some 60 m.y.a. (Feng et al. 2005); this puts a lower limit on the crown-group age of the family. However, leaves with such petioles may have small, fugaceous triangular stipules unlike those of extant taxa (Wang et al. 2011). </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Maslova (2010) placed Platanaceae in Hamamelidales, along with a number of fossil genera, some placed in the extinct Platanaceae-Gymnoplatananthoideae and also in <a name="Bogutchantaceae">Bogutchantaceae</a> (sic) N. Maslova (= Bogutchanthaceae) - see also <a href="saxifragalesweb.htm#Hamamelidaceae" target="home">Hamamelidaceae</a>). </p>

<ul><li>Platanaceae are a distinctive family. The
leaves have leaf-like stipules completely surrounding the stem, the petiole base encloses the
axillary bud, and the blades have subpalmate venation. However, <i>Platanus kerrii</i> is rather
different vegetatively from the other species, having stipules that are more or
less scarious, an axillary bud that is not enclosed by the petiole base, and
pinnate venation. In all species, the bark commonly exfoliates in characteristic plates and the
inflorescences are capitate and made up of numerous small flowers: the fruits
are small achenes with tufts of basal hairs.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The morphology of fossil Platanaceae sometimes differs substantially from that of their extant relatives (see also Kvacek 2008: whole plant reconstruction; Friis et al. 2011; Midell et al. 2014). Thus the leaves may be trifoliolate (Kvacek et al. 2001a) or imparipinnnate/ly lobed (= <i>Sapindopsis</i>: for this genus, see Doyle 2014b; Sender et al. 2016 and references), and inflorescences may have sessile or pedunculate heads. In Upper Cretaceous plants there is extensive floral variation:
staminate flowers = P 4, basally connate, stamens equal and opposite perianth members and arising from a
short ring of tissue, alternating with ?staminodes, perhaps of an outer whorl, <b>or</b> two 4- or 5-membered whorls of perianth present, A 5, pistillode consistently present, <b>or</b> P in 2 whorls, connate, outer more or
less completely so, or free; <u>G 8</u>, 2 opposite each member of inner perianth,
ovules perhaps anatropous, stylulus 0. Mindell et al. (2014) described the Late Cretaceous <i>Ambiplatanus</i> with very small heads and some perfect flowers; the 5-merous perianth was in two whorls with the stamens opposite members of the inner whorl (no comment was made about this position) and also the carpels - the latter had no style, and it is possible that the seeds were winged and the fruit dehiscent. The Middle Cenomanian <i>Verneda hermaphroditica</i> has, as its name implies, perfect flowers, also a perianth with at least three whorls, filaments that are fused basally, and a eusyncarpous and pentalocular gynoecium, yet  it is placed in this area  in morphological analyses (Moreau et al. 2016: esp. pp. 833-834). Some fossils have rather smaller pollen that
that of extant taxa - are they wind-pollinated? - insect pollination is the suggestion for some of them. Tricolporate pollen has even been found in situ in fossils assigned to Platanaceae (e.g. Manchester 1986; Crane et al. 1993; Pedersen et al. 1994; Friis et al. 1988, 2011; Magall&oacute;n-Puebla
et al. 1997: Mindell et al. 2006: Crepet et al. 2004; von Balthazar &amp; Sch&ouml;nenberger 2009; Taylor et al. 2009; Doyle &amp; Upchurch 2014 for other references). Cretaceous Platanaceae do not have hairy fruits (von Balthazar &amp; Sch&ouml;nenberger 2009; Friis et al. 2011), and the fruits may even be follicles (Crane et al. 1993). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">From the molecular point of view, at least, <i>Platanus</i> can be considered a living fossil (Sanderson &amp; Doyle 2001).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> There is about five weeks between pollination and fertilization in <i>Platanus racemosa</i>, at least (Floyd et al. 1999).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> There is some evidence from the stomatal size of fossils that polyploidization occurred within this clade (Masterson 2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Hennig et al. (1994) described the cuticle wax as lacking crystalloids, Fehrenbach and Barthlott (1988) as having
rodlets and platelets. There is some variation in stomatal morphology (Carpenter et al. 2005). Subgenus <i>Castaneophyllum</i> (<i>P. kerrii</i>) differs in lamina morphology and venation, petiole base and stipule morphology from subgenus <i>Platanus</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Von Balthazar and Sch&ouml;nenberger (2009) described the parts of the flower as alternating regularly; the androecium was biseriate, the outer, very much reduced whorl appearing late in development. Developmental studies suggest that flowers of <i>Platanus</i> are basically 4-merous (A. Douglas in Hoot et al.
1999).</p>

Proteaceae fossils are known from sediments ca 94 m.y. old in Australia, i.e., shortly after the separation of Australia from Antarctica  some 97 m.y.a. (Hill &amp; Brodribb 2006).</p>

<ul><li>Proteaceae are woody plants that may be recognised vegetatively by the broad rays in the
wood, the surface of which is often furrowed even in the twigs, the often rather scleromorphic and coriaceous leaf
blades with rather distant (or no) teeth and prominent veinlet reticulum, the swollen
leaf base and the sometimes rather short petiole (which is then bottle-shaped), and the brown indumentum. The plants smell musty. The 4-merous flowers are often aggregated into conspicuous
inflorescences; the perianth is brightly coloured and petaloid and may be monosymmetric and curved; and the stamens are opposite the perianth members. There is only one carpel and it often has a long style.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> There is a great diversity of proteaceous pollen from the late Cretaceous (Campanian-Maastrichtian) in central and southeast Australia (Dettmann &amp; Jarzen 1991, 1998; see also Friis et al. 2011), and Proteaceae seem to have been very diverse and ecologically important in at least parts of Australia (see also Itzstein-Davey 2004; Lamont &amp; He 2012, but c.f. Hill &amp; Jordan 2016 in part; Carpenter et al. 2015), Patagonia (Barreda et al. 2012), the Antarctic Peninsula (Bowman et al. 2014), and elsewhere in Gondwana by the later Cretaceous. Kooyman et al. (2014) discuss earlier possibly wider ranges of southern proteaceous genera.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although some transoceanic disjunctions in the family, for example, that of the sister taxa <i>Cardwellia</i> in Australia and <i>Gevuina</i> in South America, could reflect vicariance/continental drift events, others, like <i>Brabejum</i> in Africa which is sister to <i>Panopsis</i> in South America, involve genera whose estimated time of divergence is later than the geological events that might seem to have caused their distribution patterns (Barker et al. 2007b). The crown-group age of  Embothrieae was estimated at around 70.8 m.y. (Milner et al. 2015; 68.1-66.6 m.y. in Sauquet et al. 2009b), but although current distributions of <i>Lomatia</i> and <i>Embothrium</i>/<i>Oreocallis</i> are Gondwanan, at least some details of diversification are unconnected with the breakup of Gondwana (Milner et al. 2015; see also Weston &amp; Crisp 1994).  There has been extensive extinction of Proteaceae in New Zealand (Lee et al. 2001).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Reyes et al. (2014) found that presence in hotspots of Mediterranean diversification was correlated with diversification in Proteaceae. Monosymmetry seems to have led to both enhanced speciation and extinction, so overall no change (Reyes et al. 2014). Sauquet et al. (2009b, q.v. for much more detail) compare diversification in the Cape and S.W. Australian hotspots, and find that although more clades are to be found in the latter area, not all of them diversified much. Fires may have spurred diversification, as in <i>Banksia</i>, where flower retention on inflorescences and leaf retention on plants  may increase the intensity of fires, even if exactly how this might benefit a species is not entirely clear (He et al. 2011; see also Bond &amp; Midgley 1995). It has been suggested that fire-dominated eucalypt vegetation had begun to develop in Australia in the earliest Caenozoic a little before <i>Banksia</i> diversified (Crisp et al. 2011), but  heath vegetation with numerous Proteaceae and <i>Banksia</i> (but no Myrtaceae) and evidence of fires from Central Australia  has been dated to around 89-65.5 m.y.a. (Lamont &amp; He 2012; Carpenter et al. 2015; see also below). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Several lines of molecular evidence suggest that there may have been rapid diversification within Grevilleoideae (Hoot &amp; Douglas
1998). The stem age of the very largely Australian Banksieae is estimated at (94.9-)87.9(-80.9) m.y. (Barker et al. 2007b, q.v. for other ages). <i>Banksia</i> itself may be ca 60.8 m.y. old, the crown group (56.9-)44.5(-36.6) m.y. (He et al. 2011: HPD). More recent diversification within <i>Banksia</i> may have been instigated by vicariance events such as the aridification of the Nullarbor Plain some 14-13 m.y.a. which led to the separation of what became eastern and western clades (Crisp &amp; Cook 2007; see also Ladiges et al. 2012). However, although it is diverse in areas with Mediterranean climates, it does not seem to have undergone particularly rapid speciation, rather, unexceptionable rates over a long period of time may be the cause (Cardillo &amp; Pratt 2013). Crown group <i>Hakea</i> s. str. may be as young as (14.0-)9.6(-6.4) m.y. (Mast et al. 2012, see also 2009), although Lamont et al. (2016) suggest an age of around 14 m.y. while  Hanley et al. (2008) and especially Mast et al. (2015) suggest ages in excess of 20 m. years. The origin of this clade may be in southwest Australia, and there may have been around twelve west to east movements in the clade. <i>Hakea</i> s.l. is very diverse in S.W. Australia, where there are around 315 species, and may have begun speciating in excess of 35 m.y.a.; diversification is most rapid in a clade of <i>Hakea</i> s. str. rather than in <i>Grevillea</i> s. str. (Mast et al. 2015).</p>



 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Protea</i>, speciose in southern Africa with some 70 out of its 115 species being restricted to the Cape, has been studied by Barraclough and Reeves (2005), although they found it difficult to pin down dates for diversification there. However, Sauquet et al. (2009a, b) suggest that this may have occurred within the last 18 m.y., yet Leucadendrinae had started diversifying there as much as 39 m.y.a., even though they had been in the Cape region itself for a shorter time than <i>Protea</i>; there had been considerable diversification within Proteoideae even back the Cretaceous (Sauquet et al. 2009b). On the other hand, Schnitzler et al. (2011; Mitchell et al. 2017 for a phylogeny) suggested that diversification in <i>Protea</i> began ca 28 m.y.a. in the middle of the Oligocene and was connected with edaphic (soil mediated) speciation; rates of diversification throughout its range were similar (Valente et al. 2010b; see also Silvestro et al. 2011). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Tonnabel et al. (2014a) examined the evolution of various life history traits in <i>Leucadendron</i> (see also Barker 2004). They found frequent trade offs between traits, so if, for example, the seeds of a particular species commonly dispersed quite a distance, its pollen was not so likely to be well dispersed.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Proteaceae are most diverse in rather dry climates on nutrient-, especially phosphorus(P)-, poor old soils in Australia (see also Orians &amp; Milewski 2007) and southern Africa. Interestingly, however, salt tolerance is uncommon (Flowers et al. 2010). Fire-adapted and Proteaceae-dominated heathlands in Australia have been dated at ca 89-84 or 75-65.5 m.y.a., temperature and atmospheric oxygen concentrations being high then (Lamont &amp; He 2012; Carpenter et al. 2015 respectively).  There were numerous species of Proteaceae in these early heathlands, judging by pollen and vegetative remains, Proteoideae and Grevilleoideae being prominent components of the vegetation, and <i>Banksia</i> may have evolved by then; neither <i>Eucalyptus</i> nor other Myrtaceae were recovered in the deposits examined. This suggests that the sclerophyllous biome is much older than previously thought, and <i>Sphagnum</i> was a important component of this vegetation then, although it is not to be found in such places today (Carpenter et al. 2015; c.f. in part Lamont &amp; He 2012) and crown-group <i>Sphagnum</i> may be only 104-30 m.y.o. (Shaw et al. 2010a) or a mere ca 25 or even 14 m.y.o. (Shaw &amp; Devos 2014). Lignotubers, common in plants growing in such habitats, have evolved several times in Proteaceae. For fire in Australia, see Bradstock et al. (2012), Bowman et al. (2012), Carpenter et al. (2016, also Hill &amp; Jordan 2016; c.f. in part Bond &amp; Scott 2010). In the Cape area, the speciose <i>Protea</i> diversified 34-22 m.y.a., initially in winterwet shrublands where serotiny and sclerophylly were favoured, but moving to summerwet grasslands where larger leaves (and stature), and especially non-retention of seeds and resprouting, were favoured, speciation beginning (10.7-)7(-3.3) m.y.a. (Lamont et al. 2913: surely <i>P. sulphurea</i> plesiomorphically a shrubland species?). </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Proteaceae are distinctive in having a relatively large seed mass and both very low leaf nitrogen and high leaf mass per area (i.e. they show a decrease in SLA), the latter features tending to be linked (Cornwell et al. 2014). From examination of fossil leaves, scleromorphy may have evolved in the late Palaeocene, xeromorphy in the late Eocene/Oligocene (Hill 1998; Hill &amp; Brodribb 2001). Jordan et al. (2005, 2008) outline the evolution of scleromorphic leaf anatomy, in particular, aspects of stomatal morphology. Sclerophylly itself is implicated in photoprotection and occur in association with some combination of open, oligotrophic, cold and dry conditions, while sunken stomata help reduce water loss (Weston 2014); genera like <i>Hakea</i> s. str. are extreme sclerophylls (Lamont et al. 2016). The family as a whole shows great variation in aspects of leaf anatomy and morphology like cell size, stomatal and fine vein density, leaf size and thickness, etc., that affect productivity, transpiration, etc. (Brodribb et al. 2013), interestingly, there is no simple correlation between productivity and success. <i>Bellendena</i>, perhaps sister to the rest of the family (see below), has medium-sized stomata, while Persoonioideae (perhaps sister to <i>Bellendena</i>) and <i>Protea</i> in particular have large stomata and other anatomical features that are common in taxa of more open habitats (Brodribb et al. 2013). Aspects of leaf anatomy that facilitate the movement of water through the leaves are correlated with annual precipitation (Jordan et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The phosphorus metabolism of Proteaceae is very distinctive (Lambers et al. 2015). Proteoid roots are short lived (around a month) bottle-brush like clusters of roots of determinate growth (e.g. Lalibert&eacute; et al. 2015); they may account for over 50% of the mass of all roots of a plant at any one time (Shane &amp; Lambers 2008; see also Purnell 1960; Dinkelaker et al. 1995). In <i>Hakea prostrata</i> these roots are initiated in 5-6 longitudinal rows down the main root (Shane et al 2004b). They exude organic acids like citric acid, especially as tricarboxylates, into the soil, and this enables the plant to mobilize phosphate and perhaps other nutrients like manganese that are at a premium in the P-poor soils on which Proteaceae often grow (Shane et al. 2004b; Weston 2006); they are phosphorus miners (Lambers et al. 2008).  Furthermore, some species remove the P component of their cell membranes (as phospholipids) and divert it to maintaining their photosynthetic rates (Lambers et al. 2012a, b), while species of <i>Banksia</i> in particular show very high levels of P resorbtion prior to leaf senescence (Denton et al. 2007; see also Hayes et al. 2014). Interestingly, many members of the family develop P toxicity when growing on relatively P-rich soils; they cannot down-regulate P uptake, and it accumulates in palisade mesophyll cells in particular, eventually causing the death of the plant (Shane et al. 2004a; Shane &amp; Lambers 2008; Lambers et al. 2011 for a general summary). Particularly in Australia, and there perhaps particularly in resprouting/serotinous species, P is preferentially moved into the seeds (Denton et al. 2007; Groom &amp; Lamont 2009). Interestingly, proteoid roots also develop in <i>Lupinus</i>, <i>Arabidopsis</i> and a number of Fagales, etc., under conditions of low P and as soils age (L&oacute;pez-Bucio et al. 2003; Lambers et al. 2008; Turner et al. 2013; Kang et al. 2014: development of proteoid roots in <i>Arabidopsis</i>). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In South America soils may be richer in P, but it is not readily available (Lambers et al. 2012b). However, cluster root formation in the Patagonian <i>Embothrium coccineum</i> was induced by low nitrogen rather than low P, even if P uptake was also subsequently enhanced (Piper et al. 2013).</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Lomatia tasmanica</i> appears to be represented by a single clone about 1.2 km across; only recently the same clone may have been ca 6 km across, and fossil records suggest that it may be up to 43,600 years old (Lynch et al. 1998).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Pollination in Proteaceae is not very well known. However, secondary pollen presentation by regions at the apex of the style is common. There is great variation in these pollen presenting areas (Ladd 1994) and the pollen may even cover the stigmatic area (Ladd et al. 1996), the stigma itself often being slit- or groove-like; however, selfing is uncommon. Monosymmetric flowers are common the family, monosymmetry evolving  thirteen times or more here, with four or more reversals (Reyes et al. 2016; Citerne et al. 2017); the Cape species <i>Mimetes cucullatus</i> has monosymmetric <u>groups</u> of flowers, the pendulous polysymmetric flowers being borne under a more or less brightly coloured inflorescence bract.  The inflorescences of  some species of the Australian <i>Conospermum</i> (Proteoideae) look rather like those of <i>Anigozanthus</i> (Haemodoraceae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">It has been suggested that ca 300 species of Proteaceae in Australia may be bird-pollinated (Ford et al. 1979), but this is likely to be an underestimate. There are about 1,100 Australian species of Proteaceae, and many species, including members of the large genera <i>Grevillea</i> (?to be included in <i>Hakea</i>) and <i>Banksia</i>, are likely to be pollinated by birds (Maynard 1995), and a moderately conservative estimate is that there are ca 350 species of bird-pollinated Proteaceae there (E. T. Miller pers. comm. 12.ii.2017). Two recent studies have examined bird pollination in <i>Hakea</i> s. str., its evolution and possible relationship with cyanogenesis in the flowers. From the phylogeny provided by Mast et al. (2012), insect pollination would seem to be derived from bird pollination, while Hanley et al. (2008) suggested the opposite, however, the phylogeny of the latter was based on an earlier morphological study that could not be confirmed by Mast et al. (2012). Dates, as well as a possible association between pollinators and the presence of cyanogenic glycosides suggested by Hanley et al. (2008) also need confirmation, but see Mast et al. (2015).  In southern Africa perhaps 87 species of Proteaceae in the Cape Fynbos are pollinated by a few species of nectariniids, and particularly by the sugarbird, <i>Promerops cafer</i> (Promeropidae) (Rebelo et al. 1984: Rebelo 1987); there are two species of <i>Promerops</i>, one of which is more broadly distributed in Africa, as are Proteaceae themselves (the <i>Promerops</i> clade is quite old, around 39-33 m.y. (Beresford et al 2005; Fleming &amp; Kress 2013). In both Australia and the Cape, the prominence of ornithophily in the family may be connected with the nutrient-poor soils on which Proteaceae there grow; nectar - basically C, H, and O - costs the plant little (Rebelo 1987; Orians &amp; Milewski 2007).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In both Australia and southern Africa non-flying mammals (rodents, marsupials) are among the pollinators (Collins &amp; Rebelo 1987). Pollination in the speciose <i>Persoonia</i>, an Australian genus that lacks secondary pollen presentation, was found to be by bees (Bernhardt &amp; Weston 1996). The large Cape genus <i>Leucadendron</i>, dioecious, is commonly pollinated by nitidulid beetles, although a few species have become wind-pollinated (Welsford et al. 2016 and references).

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Serotiny is scattered in the family (see also above), the follicles opening only after a fire. <i>Banksia</i> is a major serotinous clade, although with some reversals (He et al. 2011: <i>Dryandra</i> not included, other features associated with serotiny examined). A number of the species involved have massive fruits, but there are only two seeds inside, while in other taxa the fruit is enclosed by bracts, branches, etc.. For myrmecochory in <i>Hakea</i> s.l., <i>Leucadendron</i>, etc. (Grevilleoideae and Proteoideae), see  Lengyel et al. (2009, 2010), it may have first originated in Proteaceae (58-)44.5(-32) m.y.a. (Lamont &amp; He 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Given the size of the family, caterpillars of Lycaenidae butterflies seem to eat its members quite frequently (see Fiedler 1991). Caterpillars of the dryandra moth, <i>Carthaea saturnioides</i>, the only member of a family close to the saturnines, are found only on Proteaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> In Australia, the fungal pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i> is proving especially destructive to members of this family in the Mediterranean climates of the southwest. The African <i>Faurea saligna</i> is reported to be ectomycorrhizal (H&ouml;gberg  &amp; Piearce 1986), but absence of mycorrhizae seems to be the common condition here, interestingly, other plants lacking mycorrhizae are most often herbaceous,  unlike Proteaceae (Maherali et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> Leaf morphology is very variable both within and between species in Proteaceae, particularly in Australian taxa, although it is difficult to relate this to ecological factors (Nicotra et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> That palaeo-polyploidy has been involved in the evolution of chromosome number in the family is questionable (Stace et al. 1998). There is very considerable variation in chromosome and genome size that correlates with phylogeny/habitat, but much less with chromosome number; there have been changes in stomatal size subsequent to and independent of changes in genome size (Stace et al. 1998; Jordan et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For distinctive fatty acids in the seeds, see Badami and Patil (1981); fof cyanogenic glycosides, see Swenson et al. (1989). Sieve tubes have sieve areas for most of their length. The roots have 4-7 protoxylem poles.  Nodes in <i>Panopsis</i> appear to be pentalacunar, while those of <i>Finschia</i> are trilacunar, although with some variation in the number of traces departing from each gap (Catling 2010). Cotyledonary nodes commonly have split laterals (Naubauer 1991), however, the distribution of this character is unclear. Stem lenticels are
often horizontally elongated (Keller 1996). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The flower pairs common in the family represent reduced inflorescence branches (Douglas &amp; Tucker 1996a). For variation in floral orientation, see Douglas and Tucker (1996a, b); the flowers may be mirror images, as in <i>Orites</i> (image at: www.anbg.gov.au/proteaceae/illustrations.html). In Grevilleoideae, the basical floral orientation is orthogonal to the bract immediately subtending the flower, but the position of this bract relative to the axis that bears it varies and the carpel is often (?always) oblique (Douglas &amp; Tucker 1996a; Mast et al. 2015). <i>Placospermum</i> has vertically monosymmetric flowers in which there are three staminodes and only the single adaxial stamen is fertile (see https://www.anbg.gov.au/proteaceae/600/Placospermum_coriaceum.jpg ). Proteaceous flowers can be interpreted as being dimerous (Ronse De Craene 2016b). Flowers of Proteoideae-Conospermeae show considerable developmental variation  (Douglas &amp; Tucker 1997). There is no evidence that the perianth is derived from a biseriate structure, and the individual perianth members - of <i>Macadamia</i>, at least - have three traces; for the family, 1-5 bundles supplying each tepal are reported (Weston 2006). A small, almost spine-like process that is described as a Vorla&uuml;ferspitze (Douglas &amp; Tucker 1996c) occurs just abaxial to the apex of the perianth members (see Kaplan 1973) in Persoonioideae and also elsewhere in the family. Anthers of <i>Stirlingia</i>, <i>Franklandia</i>, <i>Conosperma</i>, and <i>Synaphea</i> have an exothecium, but no endothecium (Venkata Rao 1971). The nectary has very variable vasculature and it is also very variable in morphology; it is best considered to be an enation rather than (a) modified stamen(s) (Rao 1967; Douglas &amp; Tucker 1996c). The stigma may be papillate, or it is more or less enclosed, with
exudate (Matthews et al. 1999); due to the early growth of the carpel, it may be in a more or less abaxial position on the carpel/style.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The position of the embryo sac in the ovule varies considerably (Venkata Rao 1971). Although a nucellar cap seems to be common, it can be difficult to distinguish from files of cells produced by the division of hypodermal cells (e.g. Jordaan 1945a). Manning and Brits (1993) suggested that there had been much misinterpretation of fruit/seed anatomy; their interpretation is followed here. Testa and tegmen variation is extensive, partly because the fruits are sometimes indehiscent (Venkata Rao 1971; Corner 1976). The ovary wall may also be adnate to the integuments (so the fruit is a sort of caryopsis?!). Testa anatomy is similar to that in Papaveraceae, Chloranthaceae, and Aristolochiaceae, for what that is worth. The testa and/or the tegmen may be multiplicative. Endosperm and endosperm haustorium  development is variable. Cotyledons of <i>Bellendena</i> are not cordate are they often are elsewhere in the family.  </p>

(2006), Sauquet and Cantrill (2007), and Blackmore and Barnes (1995: development, Garside's Rule), for some embryology, see Venkata Rao (1959) and Jordaan (1945b), and for a survey of seed coat anatomy, see Takhtajan (2000).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For a summary of phylogenetic studies in the family, see Weston (2014). Although the subfamilies recognised here seem to be fairly solidly supported, relationships between them are less clear.  Thus the summary tree in Weston and Barker (2006) and Weston (2006) suggest that Persoonioideae and the monotypic Bellendenoideae are sister taxa (see also Sauquet et al. 2009b); the distinctive <i>Carnarvonia</i> (fully compound leaves) and <i>Sphalmium</i> (stylulus short), sometimes segregated as subfamilies (as in  <i>The Flora of Australia</i>), may be immediately related, and although definitely to be included in Grevilleoideae, further relationships within that clade are unclear. Although understanding relationships between the major clades was not the focus of the study by Mast et al. (2012), they recovered the relationships [[Persoonoideae + Bellendenoideae] [Grevillioideae [Proteoideae + Symphionematoideae]]].</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Relationships in Proteoideae are explored by Barker et al. (2002); the Australian <i>Isopogon</i> and <i>Adenanthos</i> are sister to a clade that represents most of the subfamily, but not including <i>Protea</i> and <i>Faurea</i> (support strong for this set of relationships); unfortunately <i>Eidothea</i>, a distinctive genus segregated as Eidotheoideae in <i>The Flora of Australia</i>, was not included. For the phylogeny of <i>Leucadendron</i>, see Tonnabel et al. (2014a, b), and for that of <i>Protea</i>, see Mitchell et al. (2017 &amp; references). For relationships in <i>Hakea</i>, which includes <i>Grevillea</i> and a couple of small genera, see Mast et al. (2012, esp. 2015); <i>G. endlicheriana</i>, from S.W. Australia, is sister to the whole of the rest of the clade and <i>Hakea</i> s. str. is monophyletic. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For a new subfamilial/tribal classification, the outlines of which are followed here, and a generic checklist, see Weston and Barker (2006) and Weston (2006). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Banksia</i> is to include <i>Dryandra</i> (Mast et al. 2005; see also Thiele et al. 2015) while <i>Hakea</i> may also be expanded to include <i>Grevillea</i> and <i>Finschia</i> (Mast et al. 2015 for  possible options).</p>
