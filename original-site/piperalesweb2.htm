<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Note:</b>  <b>Boldface</b> denotes possible apomorphies, (....) denotes a feature common in the clade, exact status uncertain, [....] includes explanatory material. Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).</p>	

	

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Friis et al. (2005b) suggested that <i>Appomattoxia</i>, from the Early Cretaceous, might belong somewhere around Piperales (c.f. Friis et al. 1995, 2011), but relationships with Chloranthaceae or <i>Amborella</i> have also been suggested (Doyle &amp; Endress 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the evolution of woodiness in the order, see Trueba et al. (2015).  Although I have tentatively called Piperales as a whole herbaceous, this depends on the definition of "woody" (see also Wagner et al. 2014; Trueba et al. 2015). For some thoughts on floral evolution in Piperales, see Remizowa et al. (2005b). Piperales are characterised by having notably small seeds, other magnoliids and ANITA grade angiosperms having substantially larger seeds (Moles et al. 2005a; Sims 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> G. Liu et al. (2014) noted that the litter of Piperales tended to break down fast compared with that of other magnoliids, and they noted that many members of this order were smallish plants and hence are unlikely to have had a substantial effect on nutrient cycling.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> There are a number of reports of delayed fertilization in Piperales, including in some Piperaceae (Sogo &amp; Tobe 2006d for references). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> For the <i>PHY</i> gene, see Matthews et al. (1995).</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Carlquist et al. (1995) suggest a number of wood anatomical characters that may be common to this clade, for instance, wood in some Aristolochiaceae and Piperaceae is storied (Carlquist 1992a, 1993); Trueba et al. (2015: esp. Table 1) compared wood anatomy across the order. Isnard et al. (2012) disucuss growth form and anatomy in Piperales in some detail; <i>Aristolochia</i> and <i>Piper</i> are particularly variable in growth habit. Most taxa in the clade are sympodial in that the stem is put together by succesive axillary innovations. Inflorescences are in general terminal, rarely axillary, although Isnard et al. (2012: Fig. 17B)  suggest that growth in Piperaceae is monopodial; the climbing stage of Asian <i>Piper</i> is monopodial, but the inflorescences are terminal in sympodial plagiotropic branching systems.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The much reduced flowers of the [Piperaceae + Saururaceae] clades can be described as monosymmetric (Tucker 1984), and it is conceivable that this is an apomorphy for the whole order. Variation in embryo sac morphology in the whole clade is very considerable, but there are now attempts to put this in a phylogenetic context (e.g. Madrid &amp; Friedman 2008a, 2008b, 2009). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For some information on lianes, etc., see Rowe and Speck (2005), on crystals, etc., Horner et al. (2013, esp. 2015 - considerable variation), and for floral development, see Tucker and Douglas (1996).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> The pairing [Piperaceae + Saururaceae] has usually been strongly supported as sister to Aristolochiaceae (e.g. Neinhuis et al. 2001, Nickrent et al. 2001), and discussion over other relationships in the order hinge on the circumscription of Aristolochiaceae.  Neinhuis et al. (2000) suggested that
Lactoridaceae were not to be included in Aristolochiaceae, although subsequent analyses have tended in the opposite direction (e.g. Neinhuis et al. 2005: Lactoridaceae sister to Aristolochioideae, support weak). Similar relationships were found by Davis et al. (2004: support rather weak - &plusmn;70%, Hydnoraceae not included). In the two-gene analysis of Wanke et al. (2007: Hydnoraceae again not included) support for Lactoridaceae as sister to Aristolochioideae was quite strong (82% bootstrap: see also Borsch et al. 2005; Qiu et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 2007a), however, the position of Asaroideae was uncertain; it might be sister to [Lactoridaceae + Aristolochioideae] (most common) or to [Piperaceae + Saururaceae]; Hilu et al. (2003: <i>mat</i>K analysis alone) also thought that Aristolochiaceae were paraphyletic and included the rest of the order (Hydnoraceae were not sampled). Kelly and Gonz&aacute;lez (2003) claimed that a morphological phylogenetic analysis strongly refuted the idea that Aristolochiaceae s. str. were not monophyletic; molecular data and the coding of morphological data were to "blame" (ibid.: p. 240) for the possibility that <i>Lactoris</i> might end up in the family. See also the various analyses in Naumann et al. (2013: supplementary material). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Relationships of the parasitic Hydnoraceae were initially uncertain, although they clearly went in this general area (e.g. Barkman et al. 2007: see also Nickrent &amp;
Duff 1996; Blarer et al. 2000; Nickrent et al. 2001, 2002). Nickrent and Blarer (2005) found moderate support for the clade [Hydnoraceae + Aristolochioideae], while  the inclusion of a number of single-copy nuclear genes found that thius relationships However, Massoni et al. (2014) recovered the relationships [Asaroideae [<i>Hydnora</i> {<i>Lactoris</i>  + Aristolochioideae]]],  although support was mostly rather weak. Eventual inclusion of Hydnoraceae in Aristolochiaceae is likely. </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Takhtajan (1997) placed Aristolochiales in
Magnolianae, his Lactoridanae were monotypic, although placed immediately after Laurales and before Aristolochiales. In some
floral details, Saururaceae are very like Acoraceae (Buzgo &amp; Endress 2000), e.g. they both have monosymmetric flowers, but these probably represent convergences. Similarly, the three-merous perianth and adaxial prophylls that seem to suggest a relationship between Piperales and monocots (and Nymphaeales), the now unlikely paleoherb hypothesis (for which see e.g. Donoghue &amp; Doyle 1987), also represent parallelisms.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b>  The age of crown-group Aristolochioideae is estimated at around 39.5 or 35.1 m.y. (Naumann et al. 2013).</p>

<ul><li>Most Aristolochiaceae are more or less herbaceous plants (they are quite often vines) that may be recognised by their adaxial
prophylls, exstipulate leaves with palmate venation and entire margins, and
3-merous flowers with extrorse stamens. The ovary is usually inferior and the perianth uniseriate and
connate. Only <i>Aristolochia</i> has
monosymmetric flowers, only <i>Saruma</i> a perianth differentiated into sepals and petals.</ul>


<ul><li>Hydnoroideae are leafless and echlorophyllous root parasites
that can be recognised by their large flowers with a single, thick, basally
connate, valvate perianth whorl that is brownish and cracked outside and coloured inside, stamens opposite the perianth lobes, and inferior ovary; the fruit contains many small seeds, some 90,000 or so.</li></ul>


<ul><li><i>Lactoris</i> is a shrublet that can be recognised by its small,
two-ranked leaves with intrapetiolar stipules; the prophylls are adaxial. The flowers are small and have three
imbricate perianth members and three free carpels.</ul>




<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b>  <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The recently-described fossil <i>Hexagyne philippiana</i> whose 3-merous flowers have 6 carpels and 3 (?or 6) perianth parts ends up in Aristolochiaceae in morphological analyses, although positions in basal eudicots and even in monocots are only one step longer (Coiffard et al. 2014: note topology). The discovery of this plant, found in deposits in eastern Brazil 115-112 m.y.o., perhaps supports a Gondwanan origin of Aristolochiaceae (Coiffard et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within <i>Aristolochia</i> subgenus <i>Isotrema</i> there are two North American-East Asian disjuctions; these and other events are dated by Gonz&aacute;lez et al. (2014) to around 30 m.y.a., the initial divergence of the two herbaceous species from the rest of the subgenus, which is woody, is earlier.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Physiology &amp; Ecology.</u> Wagner et al. (2012) discuss the evolution of (weakly) shrubby members of <i>Aristolochia</i> which nevertheless retain many elements of the distinctive stem anatomy, including the broad rays, of their primitively climbing relatives. The climbing habit is likely to be an apomorphy for the genus, and woodiness perhaps derived (Wagner et al. 2014, q.v. for much other information). All told, there are perhaps 395 species of twining climbing/lianoid Aristolochioideae (see also Gentry 1991). Busch et al. (2010) describe how the percicyclic cylinder is repaired when it breaks; adjacent cells may divide and their walls become lignified.</p>
 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> There are reports of thermogenesis in the flowers of some Aristolochiaceae, including Hydnoroideae (Cocucci &amp; Cocucci 1996; Seymour 2001; Bolin et al. 2009; Seymour et al. 2009). Various forms of fly pollination are common in the family (Oelschl&auml;gel et al. 2014; Gottsberger 2016 and references). Many taxa trap the flies, specialized multicellular hairs allowing insects entrance into the floral chamber where they remain until the hairs wither and the corolla also often changes colour (Sakai 2002; Oelschl&auml;gel et al. 2009; Rintz 2009).  Nectar in <i>Aristolochia</i> may be produced on the inside of the perianth tube to feed the temporarily-trapped pollinators (Erbar 2014 and references), and it has even been suggested that flies may sup from the copious stigmatic exudate (Baker et al. 1973). Some pollinators also oviposit on the flowers, and the relationship between plant and pollinator may be specific (Sakai 2002); phorid flies may oviposit on rotting flowers (see J&uuml;rgens et al. 2013 for the various odour syndromes involved). The inside of the perianth tube of <i>Aristolochia arborea</i> looks as if it has a small mushroom growing in its mouth, and this and a number of species of <i>Asarum</i> with similar structures are pollinated by fungus gnats (Vogel 1978a; Sinn et al. 2015 and references). In a wrinkle on fly pollination, chemicals in the rather weak (to us) scent of the European <i>Aristolochia rotunda</i> specifically attract dipteran chloropid flies - these are the same chemicals as are produced by recently-dead mirid bugs. The flies are kleptoparasitic, stealing food from other insects, and also eating the secretions produced by mirid bugs when they are eaten by other arthropods (Oelschl&auml;gel et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Pollination of the foetid flowers of <i>Hydnora</i> is by flies and beetles and oviposition may also occur (Bolin et al. 2006b, 2009; Gottsberger 2016); each flower has up to 35,000 ovules. In <i>Hydnora triceps</i> both flower and fruit are underground.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Solms-Laubach (1874) described the thickened testa wall of <i>Prosopanche</i> as "schaumige" (frothy); dispersal is by mammals. Seeds with arils are probably dispersed by ants.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> <i>Aristolochia</i> is eaten by caterpillars of the magnificent birdwing butterflies (<i>Ornithoptera</i>) of the Papilionidae-Papilioninae-Troidini. The association between caterpillars of these butterflies and Aristolochiaceae - they are apparently not found on <i>Saruma</i>, although larvae of the related <i>Luehdorfia</i> and other genera of the Parnassiinae are found here - has been studied in some detail (e.g. Weintraub 1995). Papilionidae are the only butterflies whose larvae eat Aristolochiaceae (Condamine et al. 2011), but there seems to be no particular association between the phylogeny or chemistry of Aristolochiaceae and the phylogeny of the butterflies (Silva-Brand&atilde;o &amp; Solferini 2007; Simonsen et al. 2011). Based on relationships in a morphological phylogeny [<i>Cressida</i> [<i>Pharmacophagus</i> + <i>Ornithoptera</i>] [<i>Battus</i> etc.]]] and correlation with geography Parsons (1996) invoked continental drift to explain the distributions of birdwings and their relatives, but the butterfly relationships he found are very different from those suggested elsewhere - even if there is still hardly any general agreement about relationships. Furthermore, estimates of when Papilionidae diversified vary by a factor of over two (Simonsen et al. 2011 for literature), Condamine et al. (2011) even suggesting that it began in the early Caenozoic (62.5-)52(-46) m.y. ago. Aristolochiaceae may be the original larval food for the larvae of all Papilionidae (minus <i>Baronia</i>: Condamine et al. 2011; see also Ehrlich &amp; Raven 1964), while Simonsen et al. (2011) invoked two major shifts onto the family, and some swallowtails also eat <i>Aristolochia</i> (Berenbaum &amp; Feeney 2008).  Swallowtails have also shifted their host to Apiaceae, Rutaceae, etc. (Fordyce 2010; Simonsen et al. 2011; Condamine et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> At some 24 kb, the plastid genome in <i>Hydnora visseri</i> is the smallest known; plastid genes, now non-functional, are scattered in the mitochondrial genome (Naumann et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Aristolochic acid is closely related
biosynthetically to benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (Gershenzon &amp; Mabry
1981). </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Aristolochia</i> has
cuticular wax rodlets, but other genera lack crystalloids. Ding Hou (1984) notes that the leaves wither on the plant and do not abscise. The shrubby habit is derived within <i>Aristolochia</i>, and the cork is (eventually) deep seated (Wagner et al. 2014), although in the illustrations in Carlquist (1993, q.v. for anatomical features common in the family) it appears to be outer cortical. The central leaf trace of the woody <i>Aristolochia arborea</i>
appears to have three parts, but this may well be a single trace broken up by the
broad rays. <i>Aristolochia clematitis</i> appears to have
lateral prophylls; Gonz&aacute;lez and Rudall (2001) suggested that the stipule of <i>Lactoris</i> is initially paired. Lobed leaves are known from <i>Aristolochia</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The anatomy of Hydnoroideae needs attention, and one problem is understanding the morphological nature of the organs being examined. In <i>Prosopanche burmeisteri</i> and <i>Hydnora africana</i> the vascular bundles of the angled "rhizoid" are in a strongly medullated star-like arrangement with a varying number of rays (Schimper 1880). The vascular bundles on the rays of the star  face away from each other, and in <i>P. burmeisteri</i> the ring is interrupted so there seem to be two systems of vascular bundles. The outer of the rhizoid cells have suberin, and cork develops somewhat later. "Appendages" of <i>P. burmeisteri</i>, which develop along the angles of the rhizoids, had a small amount of vascular tissue in the centre. Wagner et al. (2014) confirmed the cauline nature of the rhizoids. However, Schimper (1880) drew the rhizoids of <i>H. abyssinica</i> as being round in t.s. and with numerous scattered vascular bundles, an anatomy which would seem to have nothing to do with that of either <i>Prosopanche</i> and <i>Hydnora africana</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There has been much discussion about the nature of the perianth in the family. The uniseriate perianth may be derived from the outer whorl of a biseriate perianth (Gonz&aacute;lez &amp; Stevenson 2000). In any inner whorl, whether in <i>Asarum</i>, <i>Saruma</i> or <i>Thottea</i>, "petal" bases are narrow, while the bases of members of the outer whorl are very broad and encircle the floral axis. It has been suggested that "petals" are derived from stamens (see also Leins &amp; Erbar 1995; Kelly 2001; Ronse De Craene et al. 2003); they were drawn as staminodes and described as petal appendages by Ronse de Craene (2010). Their position in some species of <i>Asarum</i>, in the angles of the outer whorl, makes any staminodial origin unlikely and would also suggest that the perianth tube is hypanthial. In <i>Asarum</i>, there are stamens  more or less adnate to the style. However, in <i>Thottea</i> structures in the positions of petals may be stamens (Leins et al. 1988). Jaramillo and Kramer (2004) describe the basic perianth condition for the family as being unipartite (= uniseriate), with its ancestors having "multiple" whorls. For the development og monosymmetry in <i>Aristolochia</i>, in which <i>CYC</i> genes are not much in evidence, see Horn et al. (2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The median outer perianth member is adaxial (Gonz&aacute;lez &amp; Stevenson 2000a) in some taxa, although it is abaxial in <i>Aristolochia</i> s. str., but with the exception of <i>A. grandiflora</i>, and also in <i>Pararistolochia</i> (Neinhuis et al. 2005: ?other taxa). Spichiger et al. (2004) have a floral diagram for <i>Aristolochia</i> where the six stamens and carpels are not opposite to the perianth members - nor would be opposite sepals or petals, if such were present. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Gonz&aacute;lez and Stevenson (2000b) note that the stigmas of <i>Aristolochia</i> are commissural (see also Leins &amp; Erbar 1985), and that when there is only a single whorl of stamens in the flower, it is the inner whorl. Endress (1994c) suggested that the androecium in <i>Lactoris</i> was adnate to the gynoecium, as in other Aristolochiaceae, but at most it is adnate to the stipe of the gynoecium; ovary position is variable around here. <i>Thottea</i> has four placentae and presumably four carpels, but there are about twice as many - or even more - styles; these surround an open gynoecium (Leins et al. 1988; c.f. Endress 2014).  Leins and Erbar (1995) described the flowers of <i>Saruma</i>, which are rather different from those of the rest of the family (see also Sinn et al. 2015). There sepals and petals are quite distinct and the nine carpels are adnate to the hypanthium, but are largely
free from one another. All in all, rather confusing. An illustration in Engler (1888) shows a bistomal micropyle.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In Hydnoroideae, carpel orientation is suggested by

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Morphology and molecules (ITS) suggest similar relationships in <i>Asarum</i> (Kelly 1998, c.f. 1997), and a recent study suggests that <i>A. epigynium</i>, from Taiwan, may be sister to the rest of the genus (Sinn et al. 2015). Although the
monophyly of <i>Aristolochia</i> s.l. is not in question, it encompasses quite a lot of variation. There are four main clades that are all well supported, one of which includes just two species (Gonz&aacute;lez &amp; Stevenson 2002; Neinhuis et al. 2005; Wanke et al. 2006b; Ohi-Toma et al. 2006). Gonz&aacute;lez et al. (2014) looked at relationships within subgenus <i>Isotrema</i>; the herbaceous North American <i>A. reticulata</i> and <i>A. serpentaria</i> are sister to the rest of the group. Within <i>Thottea</i>, <i>T. piperiformis</i> is sister to the rest of the genus (Oelschl&auml;gel et al. 2011).</p>

<ul><li><i>Saruma</i> (Asaroideae) is distinctive: nodes with two
traces from central gap; hypanthium +; calyx and corolla distinct, C clawed; pollen sulcate (indistinctly 3-porate); G 9, adnate to hypanthium, otherwise
free from each other, (micropyle bistomal).</li></ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> See Huber (1985) for an infrafamilial classification. <i>Asarum</i> can be circumscribed broadly, as here, or divided into a number of genera. Huber (1993) suggested that <i>Aristolochia</i> could be divided
into eight genera, some of which would be well characterised morphologically. Some splitting, perhaps into four genera, all with synapomorphies, seems to be favoured (Gonz&aacute;lez &amp; Stevenson 2002; Neinhuis et al. 2005; Wanke et al. 2006b), but <i>Aristolochia</i> s.l. is immediately recognizable (Buchwalder 2014)!</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous relationships.</b> <i>Lactoris</i> had until recently been placed in its own family, Lactoridaceae, and included in Magnoliales (Cronquist 1981), or by itself in Lactoridanae - but on the page after Aristolochiaceae (Takhtajan 1997. Hydnorales were placed in Rafflesiales by Cronquist (1981) and Rafflesianae by Takhtajan (1997); Cocucci and Cocucci (1996) saw connections between Hydnoraceae and Annonaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2011) suggested an age of (51-)47, 41(-37) m.y. for this node; the age is about 91.2 m.y. in Smith et al. (2008), 90.8 m.y. in Chomicki and Renner (2015), and only 34.3 m.y. in Naumann et al. (2013). Symmank et al. (2011) dated stem <i>Peperomia</i> to ca 57 m.y. while Mart&iacute;nez et al. (2014) dated crown <i>Piper</i> to (114-)111(-110) m.y.a. - Piperaceae are another clade with conflicting estimates of ages (see also below). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Indeed, fossil evidence led Mart&iacute;nez et al. (2012, esp. 2014) to think that <i>Piper</i> originated in the early Cretaceous, a crown-group age of (117-)111(-109) m.y.a. being driven by the attribution of a Late Cretaceous Colombian fossil to the stem group of the extant Schilleria clade of neotropical <i>Piper</i>. </p>

<p>Synonymy: <b>Peperomiaceae</b> A. C. Smith</p>

<ul><li>Piperaceae may be recognised vegetatively by their
herbaceous habit and/or their separate vascular bundles in the stem, their
swollen nodes, and their soft and/or fleshy leaves that are often cordate at
the base. The minute flowers lack a
perianth and are often borne in dense spikes; individual flowers are subtended by peltate to clavate bracts. Some New World species of <i>Piper</i> look remarkably
like Araceae and grow in the same habitat.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>   The discovery that <i>Verhuellia</i> is sister to the rest of the family (Wanke et al. 2007b) changes hypotheses about the apomorphies of the family. However, of the three genera in the two clades that are successively sister to <i>Piper</i> and <i>Peperomia</i>, we know little about two.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There was a major uptick in diversification rates at the Piperoideae node (Massoni et al. 2015a; see also Tank et al. 2015). J. F. Smith et al. (2008) estimated that although crown group diversification in <i>Piper</i> and <i>Peperomia</i> began ca 71.75 and 88.9 m.y.a. respectively, much species diversification was mid-Caenozoic and later (in <i>Peperomia</i>  ca 57 m.y.a.). Mart&iacute;nez et al. (2012, esp. 2014: note topology, comparison with <i>Lactoris</i>, etc., not relevant) estimated that the stem age of New World <i>Piper</i> was (106-)93, 69(-67) m.y.a., and with the older estimate diversification in South America was well under way by the end of the Eocene, although much diversification was much younger - thus  they suggest that that the Macrostachys and Radula clades, which between then include around half the 1,300 neotropical species of the genus, began  diversifying around ca 45 m.y.a., the average age of the species examined being 7 and 11 m.y.a. respectively. Although Symmank et al. (2011) dated stem <i>Peperomia</i> to ca 57 m.y.a., estimates of diversification were again much later. Diversification in the largely South American <i>Peperomia</i> subgenus <i>Tildenia</i> - distinctive, the plants are cormose and have peltate leaves - started ca 15 m.y.a., and it twice dispersed to Central America (Symmank et al. 2011; see also  Naumann et al. 2011).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Smith et al. (2008) suggested ages for various clades within both <i>Piper</i> and <i>Peperomia</i>, and noted the extent of geographical signal of the clades; extensive migration occurred in both genera. For ranges of neotropical species of <i>Piper</i> and their distribution patterns, see Quijano-Abril et al. (2006: track-compatability analyses) and Paul and Tonsor (2008).  Jaramillo and Manos (2001) discuss the phylogeny and morphology of <i>Piper</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Peperomia</i> is a notable component of the epiphytic flora, particularly in the neotropics; the epiphytic habit is derived, as is the geophytic habit - several times (Symmank et al. 2008). Crassulacean acid metabolism is common in these epiphytes. There is considerable variation in the nature (druses, raphides) and pattern of oxalate deposition in the leaf (Horner et al. 2009, 2012, 2015 - spectacular under polarizing light), but there is not that much correlation with phylogeny; Kuo-Huang et al. (2007) suggest how the druses might be involved in photosynthesis. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Piper</i> is one of the major components of the understory in neotropical lowland rainforests, with fifty or more species occuring in quite limited areas. As noted below, it is a member of associations involving numerous species of diverse groups of insects and other organisms (references in Dyer &amp; Palmer 2004), in particular, it is a major source of food for <i>Carollia</i> bats (see below). Many of the plant-animal interactions both of <i>Piper</i> and <i>Peperomia</i> have been linked to the possession by the plant of piperamides, a class of nitrogenous compounds with the general formula R-(C=O)-NH<sub>2</sub>, where one or two of the H atoms are variously replaced (Dyer et al. 2004). Piperamides deter generalist herbivores in particular, and individual species of <i>Piper</i> may have distinctive piperamides to which particular species of <i>Eois</i>, for example, may be adapted (Dyer et al. 2004; Richards et al. 2010). For the coexistence of members of species groups, herbivory, and interspecific diversity in secondary metabolites, see Sedio et al. (2017).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Gentry (1991) estimated  that there were some 125 species of scandent Piperaceae in the New World, while practically all Old World <i>Piper</i> are climbers of one sort or another (for additional references, see Schnitzer et al. 2015). All told, there are around 675 climbing species of <i>Piper</i> ranging from vines to quite large lianes (Gentry 1991; Rani Asmarayani pers. comm. xii.2015). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In the single-layered palisade tissue in <i>Peperomia</i> a druse in the centre of each cell may help deflect light to the surrounding chloroplasts; the thylakoids in the chloroplasts are at right angles to the druse (Horner 2012). For window-leaved <i>Peperomia</i> in the Andes, see Horner et al. (2016).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> For a summary of pollination, see Gottsberger (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The four to five (to nine?) species of <i>Carollia</i> bats (Phyllostomidae) are abundant, wide-ranging New World bats that preferentially eat and disperse the relatively high-quality (nutritionally) fruits of <i>Piper</i> (and some <i>Peperomia</i>), 45-47% of the diet of <i>C. perspicillata</i> consisting of <i>Piper</i>, with maybe 34 spikes being eaten a night (Fleming 1988, 2004); they are fast feeders, ingesting the whole fruit, the seeds being dispersed in the faeces. <i>Piper</i> lives in the understory and in early successional habitats, and the altitudinal ranges of the bats and plant are similar (Fleming 1986). The bats can be attracted by essential oil extracts (Mikich et al. 2003; Muscarella &amp; Fleming 2008; Lobova et al. 2009).  There are a <u>lot</u> of species of <i>Piper</i> - maybe up to ca 1,500, with up to 64 at a single l.t.r.f. location (Salazar &amp; Marquis 2012) - in the New World, and only a few species of <i>Carollia</i>. Although <i>Piper</i> specialists eat <i>Piper</i> when it is available, local stocks of fruits may soon be exhausted and the bats turn to a variety of other genera for food (Fleming 1986; Muscarella &amp; Fleming 2008). <i>Carollia</i> is on occasion insectivorous (Datzmann et al. 2010), and it may also disperse larger-seeded plants (Melo et al. 2009), while the phyllostomid <i>Sturnira</i>, usually a <i>Solanum</i> specialist, sometimes also eats <i>Piper</i> (Fleming 1986).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">All the evidence suggests that <i>Piper</i> diversification began a long time before that of the bats, ca 72 m.y.a. (see above) vs (26-)20(-18) m.y., the latter being the stem-group age for the bats (Fleming 2004; Datzmann et al. 2010), so how the current apparently close relationship between the two developed is unclear.  Old World species of <i>Piper</i> are bird-dispersed (Fleming 2004). See also <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#Cladeasymmetries" target="home">Clade Asymmetries</a>. </p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Neotropical <i>Piper</i> in particular has numerous associations with insects, and <i>Piper</i> insects are in turn associated with other insects, all in all being an important contributor to insect diversity, and both the number of species of <i>Piper</i> and the diversity of their secondary metabolites are contributing factors (Richards et al. 2015). Maybe as many as 500-1,000 species of the geometrid moth <i>Eois</i> (species numbers here are very uncertain) feed on <i>Piper</i> in the neotropics, and the crown age of the neotropical members of the moth (they form a clade) is dated to around (36-)32(-16) m.y.a. (Strutzenberger &amp; Fiedler 2011). This age is in line with that of extensive diversification of <i>Piper</i> itself, estimated at occuring after 21.5 m.y.a. (Smith et al. 2008, but see above), and also with the uplift of the Andes. These moths only rarely occur on other Piperaceae, on Chloranthaceae, etc., and there is only a single record from a plant not containing ethereal oils (!Gesneriaceae, see Strutzenberger et al. 2010). Most diverse at mid elevations, <i>Eois</i> may comprise 10% of the geometrids there.  Diversification in the moth was estimated to have occurred within the last 23 m.y.a., with radiation of small clades of <i>Eois</i> on single species of <i>Piper</i> (lineage duplication) happening within the Pleistocene, i.e. in the last 2.6 m.y., however, there is no signal of strong co-evolution of the two (Strutzenberger &amp; Fiedler 2011). </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Relationships are complex. Herbivores that may eat plants other than <i>Piper</i> also attacked a number of  species of <i>Piper</i>, while specialist herbivores occurred where <i>Piper</i> species were diverse chemically; predators avoided these  animals (they contained nasty chemicals from <i>Piper</i> that they had sequestered), but parasitoids attacked them (there were no predators around) (Richards et al. 2015).  A potentially very large number of braconid wasps (<i>Parapanteles</i>) are parasitoids on <i>Eois</i> caterpillars (there are other parasitoids), although less is known about its radiation, but this, too seems be Pleistocene in age (J. S. Wilson et al. 2011a).  Ants are associated with some species of <i>Piper</i> at lower elevations and protect them (e.g. Letourneau 2004; Chomicki &amp; Renner 2015, q.v. for dates - quite recent); obligate myrmecophytism  has evolved more than once in the genus (Tepe et al. 2004, 2007: anatomy of <i>Piper</i>). Bats eat <i>Eois</i> (also primarily at lower elevations) and also the fruits of <i>Piper</i> (see above), beetles  eat the ants, while mirid bugs, herbivory by leaf cutter ants and other generalist herbivores, etc., are all part of the complex set of associations centred on <i>Piper</i> (Gastreich &amp; Gentry 2004; Rico-Gray &amp; Oliveira 2007; Fincher et al. 2008; Richards et al. 2010; J. S. Wilson et al. 2011a). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Economic Importance.</b> For the black pepper, <i>Piper nigrum</i>, see Ravindran (2000).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Aerial roots of <i>Piper</i> have superficial cork cambium and a vascular cylinder with a very broad pith (Raman et al. 2012). Vascular bundles in the stem may develop acropteally, basipetally from the leaves, There is some confusion surrounding the terms used to describe the leaf. The petiole is more or less broadly sheathing and with lateral flanges for all or some of its length. Prophylls, at least on fertile plagiotropic branches I have seen, are comparable with this basal part of the petiole; there are no structures that can usefully be called stipules. The prophylls of <i>Piper</i> are drawn as being lateral (Blanc &amp; Andraos 1983). The leaves of Piperaceae may be rich in silica (Westbrook et al. 2009). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The inflorescence of <i>Zippelia</i> is described as being racemose, but with the flowers being arranged sympodially (Lei et al. 2002). For the development of the peltate bracts, see Endress (1975). Syncarpy is weak; <i>Piper</i> has
separate carpel primordia. Each carpel has a single ventral bundle. The embryo at least sometimes lacks a suspensor, but I am not sure of the distribution of this feature, while in <i>Zippelia</i> the zygote remains as such up to the maturity of the seed and in <i>Peperomia</i> it may not be much bigger (Madrid &amp; Friedman 2010). In <i>Zippelia</i> and some <i>Piper</i> the endotegmen alone is persistent.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is extensive variation in the differentiation of the embryo in Piperaceae, and the polarity of evolution of this feature is unclear, as is that of micropylar morphology, etc. There is also considerable variation - some infraspecific - in the particlar kind of tetrasporic embryo sac development in the family (Arias &amp; Williams 2008: <i>Verhuellia</i> not yet studied). The embryo sac of <i>Peperomia</i> is
very variable, ranging from three-celled (but with 14 polar nuclei) to a common condition of ten cells with seven polar nuclei (e.g. Fagerlind 1939a, b and references; Madrid &amp; Friedman 2010), that of <i>Zippelia</i> is 16-celled, while that of <i>Piper</i> is 8-celled, the antipodals being polyploid. Madrid and Friedman (2008a, 2009) suggest that the basic embryo sac for the family - at least all the family minus the currently unstudied <i>Verhuellia</i> - may be the <i>Drusa</i> type, which is tetrasporic and with sixteen cells, 11 of which congregate at the chalazal end (three of the megaspores migrate there first). The endosperm ranges from 15n (in <i>Peperomia</i>) to triploid. Kanta (1963) noted that there was extensive division of the antipodal cells during early seed development.  The nucellar cells of <i>Peperomia</i>, at least, are in radiating files (Fagerlind 1939a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some information is taken from  Bornstein
(1991) and Tebbs (1993: general), Hegnauer (1969, 1990: chemistry), Piperno (2006: phytoliths), Weberling
(1970: stipules), Burger (1972: Central American <i>Piper</i>), Blanc and Andraos (1983, 1984: growth patterns), Johnson (1914), Murty (1959), Kanta (1963), and Johri et al. (1992), all embryology, and Lei et al. (2002: embryology of <i>Zippelia</i>); for floral development, see Lei and Liang (1998: <i>Piper</i>; 1999: <i>Peperomia</i>), Tucker et al. (1993:  <i>Zippelia</i>), and Samain et al. (2010a: <i>Verhuellia</i>). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Relationships may be [<i><a name="Verhuellia">Verhuellia</a></i> [[<i>Zippelia</i> + <i><a name="Manekia">Manekia</a></i>] [<i>Piper</i> + <i>Peperomia</i>]]] (Jaramillo &amp; Callejas 2004; Wanke et al. 2006a, 2007a, b; Naumann et al. 2013: these relationships not always obtained; Z.-D. Chen et al. 2016); this entails redrawing the old subfamilial boundaries. Massoni et al. (2015a) found a clade [<i>Zippelia</i> + <i>Manekia</i>]</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Jaramillo and Callejas (2004) and Smith et al. (2005, 2008) found that <i>Piper</i> s. str. was divided into New and Old World clades, the latter, <i>Piper</i> s. str., being divided into a mainland Asian clade, containing both the two endemic African species and a species from Australia, and also a Pacific islands <i>Macropiper</i> clade including the economically very important <i>Piper methysticum</i> (Jaramillo &amp; Callejas 2004 found that one African species they examined grouped with their Pacific clade - see also Jaramillo et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2008). This Pacific clade, the <i>Macropiper</i> clade, is either sister to the rest of the genus or sister to the Asian clade (Jaramillo et al. 2008). Paul and Tonsor (2008) discuss aspects of the diversification of <i>Piper</i> in the New World. Interestingly, in a <i>trn</i>K/<i>mat</i>K analysis, Wanke et al. (2007a) found much less resolution within <i>Piper</i> than <i>Peperomia</i>. For the phylogeny of <i>Peperomia</i>, see Wanke et al. (2006a, 2007a), Samain et al. (2009: but c.f. outgroup, characters used) and Naumann  et al. (2011). Many of the characters previously considered to be systematically important in <i>Peperomia</i> have evolved in parallel (Samain et al. 2009). </i>

<ul><li><i>Peperomia</i> is a morphologically and anatomically very distinctive genus. It has spiral or opposite leaves, usually with narrow insertions on the stem and lacking stipules, the flowers have two
bisporangiate/monothecal extrorse stamens, inaperturate pollen, a single carpel with a penicillate stigma, and an unitegmic ovule, the integument being ca 2 cells across. </li></ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For the classification of Piperaceae followed here, see Samain et al. (2008, 2010a); unfortunately, the subfamilies are not easily characterisable. Although <i>Peperomia</i> is so distinctive, its recognition as a separate family would make Piperaceae paraphyletic.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> <i>Peperomia</i> has the dubious distinction of having the most herbarium names of any genus, about 1,530. These are names known primarily from herbarium sheets and were coined mostly by William Trelease - and are mostly synonyms (Mathieu 2007). Frenzke et al. (2015) assign 80% of the species of the genus to 14 well-supported monophyletic subgenera that they characterize in detail.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b>  Possible crown-group ages for the family are (84-)78, 75(-69) m.y. (Wikstr&ouml;m et al. 2001), (77-)54, 47(-26) m.y. (Bell et al. 2010), or (80.8-)63.9, 51.8(-46.7) m.y.a. (Massoni et al. 2015a).</p>

<ul><li>Saururaceae may be recognised by their often aromatic
and rather fleshy leaves with broad bases, adaxial stipules, and palmate venation and by their
spicate inflorescences that usually have a large, basal inflorescence bract. The flowers are small, without a perianth, but
there are clearly three to four carpels.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b>  <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  Smith and Stockey (2007b) described a fossil assigned to Saururaceae, <i>Saururus tuckerae</i>, from the Middle Eocene ca 44.3 m.y.a., and although its stamen number differs from those normally associated with the family, there is clearly much variability here (see also Massoni et al. 2015b). For other records of fossils, see Friis et al. (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> <i>Saururus cernuus</i> has a stigmatic self-incompatibility mechanism (Pontieri &amp; Sage 1999). Armbruster et al. (2002) described <i>Houttuynia</i> as being partly syncarpous and with a compitum.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Anemopsis</i>, alone in the family, has a relatively well developed vascular cambium and also vessel elements with simple perforations (Carlquist et al. 1995). The stomata of <i>Houttuynia</i> are surrounded by cells that are arranged spirally (Peterson et al. 2010). According to Murty
(1960) the single intrapetiolar stipule represents two, connate stipules (see also <i>Lactoris</i> above).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The small individual floral bracts of <i>Anemopsis</i> are petal-like. Ovules of <i>Houttuynia</i> lack parietal tissue. Each carpel has two ventral bundles, whether or not they are fused.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some information is taken from Raju (1961: embryology), Wood (1971: general), Hegnauer (1963, 1990: chemistry), Wu and Kubitzki (1993: general), Carlquist et al. (1995: wood anatomy), Tucker (1981 and references) and Liang et al. (1996), both floral development, Liang and Tucker (1990: floral anatomy), and Smith and Stockey (2007a: pollen ultrastructure).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> <i>Houttuynia</i> and <i>Anemopsis</i> are sister taxa and sister to the rest of the family in a <i>mat</i>R analysis (Meng et al. 2002, 2003). A clade made up of this pair of genera is also found in a three-gene analysis, but the support is poor; [<i>Saururus</i> + <i>Gymnotheca</i>] is a better-supported clade (Jaramillo et al. 2002). These two pairs of genera are also recovered in other molecular analyses (e.g. Neinhuis et al. 2005; Massoni et al. 2014), although they are not found in morphological studies.</p>
