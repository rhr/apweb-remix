 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Background.</b> As little as thirty years ago our understanding of the evolution of land plants was very different from what it is now. Then it was usually thought that <i>Psilotum</i> represented a very ancient group, often being compared with plants from the Devonian Rhynie Chert; that horsetails were also ancient (but not immediately related), and were linked to the fossil <i>Sphenophyllum</i> and its relatives; and that <i>Lycopodium</i>, <i>Selaginella</i> and relatives formed a group, after which came ferns, gymnosperms, and seed plants. Bryophytes, that is mosses, liverworts and hornworts, represented the earliest land plants. Relationships between the bryophytes was unclear, but they seemed to form a group, while the aquatic Characeae (inc. <i>Nitella</i>) with their quite complex haploid plant bodies were thought to be the algal group most closely related to land plants (e.g. Graham 1993). Evolution seemed to have resulted in a fairly straightforward increase in complexity, but this comforting sequence has been severely challenged over the last twenty years or so. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Relatives of Land Plants.</b> Land plants or Embryopsida are members of a clade embedded in a largely aquatic paraphyletic group, the "green algae" (paraphyletic groups will be denoted by scare quotes); the two together make up Viridiplantae.  Viridiplantae can be divided into two main groups, Chlorophyta s. str. and Streptophyta, the latter including "Charophyta s.l." within which Embryopsida are embedded. For general information on the evolution of Chlorophyta and the streptophytes, see e.g. Lemieux et al. (2000),  Turmel et al. (2002), Sanders et al. (2003), Waters (2003), Delwiche et al. (2004), Lewis and McCourt (2004), Becker et al. (2009), and Leliaert et al. (2012, a great deal of information, 2016). Lewis and McCourt (2004) emphasize that many clades of "green algae" have terrestrial representatives, of which Embryopsida are merely the most prominent. Leliaert et al. (2016) note a number of similarities in the chloroplast genome between their Palmophyllophyceae, perhaps sister to other chlorophyta, and <i>Mesostigma</i>, de Vries et al. (2016) note numerous features common in/characteristic of embryophytes that are also to be found in streptophytes, and they discuss changes in the chloroplast in partticular, and  Buschmann and Zachgo (2016) looks at the evolution of the distinctive embryophyte mode of cell division from a similar point of view (see also below).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Within Chlorophyta s. str. there are several algae that are involved in lichen formation (<i>Trebouxia</i> and its relatives) as well as several ecologically very important marine algae. <i>Volvox</i>, <i>Caulerpa</i>, <i>Ulva</i> and <i>Acetabularia</i> are other Chlorophyta.</p>

<p><font face="verdana, georgia, arial, serif" size="3.5"><b>STREPTOPHYTES</b></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">These include land plants (= embryophytes or Embryopsida) and a subset of freshwater green algae like <i>Mesostigma viride</i> (biciliate), <i>Chlorokybus</i>, <i>Klebsormidium</i>, <i>Spirogyra</i>, <i>Coleochaete</i>, and <i>Chara</i>.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Stem streptophytes have been dated to 1200-725 m.y. (Yoon et al. 2004: <i>Chaetosphaeridium</i> vs. the rest), while Zimmer et al. (2007) give an age of (963-)725(-587) m.y. for the divergence of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> from the streptophytes.  </p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> It is becoming increasingly clear that what appear to be land plant innovations may first appear more basally in the streptophyte clade (e.g. Becker &amp; Marin 2009; Popper &amp; Tuohy 2010; Wodniok et al. 2011). Lang et al. (2010) noted that a considerable number of transcription-associated protein families evolved in the basal land plants or their immediate aquatic ancestors, many more than subsequently, but exactly where subsequent changes occur is unclear since nothing between <i>Selaginella</i> and angiosperms was included in this study. For the synthesis of the cell wall polysaccharides so important in land plants, but also found here, see Mikkelsen et al. (2014). Boot et al. (2012) found that there was polar auxin transport in <i>Chara</i>; it is known from the sporophytic generation in mosses, etc., but not liverworts. A number of streptophytes have phragmoplasts (Brown &amp; Lemmon 2007 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are several other features common in streptophytes. The zoospores are covered with small square scales and have paired cilia that are laterally inserted, joining a multilayered structure (Mattox &amp; Stewart 1984; Simon et al. 2006). The photorespiratory glycolate pathway occurs in peroxisomes rather than in mitochondria (Stabenau &amp; Winkler 2005). The BIP multigene family is prominent (Friedl &amp; Rybalka 2012).  The duplication yielding the important <i>GAPA/B</i> gene pair occurred around here, and streptophytes have a particular isoform of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydogenase, GAPDH B (Peterson et al. 2006). For characters of  streptophytes and some of their subgroups, see Leliaert et al. (2012: esp. Fig 4). Buschmann and Zachgo (2016) discuss the evolution of  cell division. In basal streptophytes there is a cleavage furrow and the new transverse wall develops centripetally while in embryophytes the cell plate develops centrifugally where the preprophase band (p.p.b.) of microtubules had been, and basal streptophytes have a centrosome from which radiating microtubules develop and are involved in pulling the dividing chromosomes apart while in most embryophytes neither centrosome nor radiating microtubules develop. These changes are complex. Many of them are evident in various groups of streptophytes close to the embryophytes, although some show parallelism and even loss there (Buschmann &amp; Zachgo 2016). Thus  <i>Mougeotia</i>, in the clade sister to Embryopsida, lacks centrioles and has a p.p.b., while <i>Coleochaete</i> (same clade, or next clade down) has monoplastidic meiosis and centrioles (e.g. Brown &amp; Lemmon 1993, 2011b). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u>  Leliaert et al. (2012) summarize variation in the plastid and mitochodrial genomes in  streptophytes and compare it with that in land plants, and some of this may convert to apomorphies when comparative data improve. A possible synapomorphy for the node that includes <i>Mesostigma viride</i> and the rest is the presence of the <i>ndh</i> and <i>rps</i>15 and the loss of the <i>rps</i>9 chloroplast genes, although <i>Chara</i> has the <i>rps</i>9 but not the <i>rps</i>15 genes (Mart&iacute;n &amp; Sabater 2010); the presence of introns in the <i>ndh</i>A and <i>ndh</i>B genes may also be apomorphies around here. Both <i>Zygnema</i> and the desmid <i>Staurastrum</i> secondarily lack the chloroplast inverted repeat, present in other streptophytes (Turmel et al. 2007), indeed, evidence now suggests that the IR may have been lost several times in the [Zygnematales + Desmidales] clade as well as in <i>Coleochaete</i> (Civ&aacute;n et al. 2014; Lemieux et al. 2016). Indeed, in general the chloroplast genome in the [Zygnematales + Desmidales] is very labile,  group II introns frequently being lost, and some phage/viral genes have been gained, although overall the genes it contains are much less labile (see esp. Lemieux et al. 2016). For similarities in the organisation of the chloroplast genome in particular between basal streptophytes and basal green algae, see Leliaert et al. (2016). </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Resolving the relationship of the polyphyletic prasinophytes, mostly Chlorophyta, has been important (e.g. Lewis &amp; McCourt 2004; Niklas &amp; Kutschera 2010; esp. Leliaert et al. 2016 and references). <i>Mesostigma viride</i>, the only streptophyte with an eye spot, used to be included in that group, but along with <i>Chlorokybus</i> it is sister to the other streptophytes, as is indicated by nuclear and some, but by no means all, organellar genes (E. Kim et al. 2006: isoprenoid synthesis pathways and glycolate oxidizing enzymes agree). Its zoospores have scales but lack a cellulose cell wall (J. Petersen et al. 2006) and it links with the non-motile <i>Chlorkybus</i> (Simon et al. 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">It was often thought that Characeae (inc. <i>Nitella</i>) were the immediate sister group of land plants (e.g. Graham 1993: still useful and readable; Karol et al. 2001; Turmel et al. 2003; Delwiche et al. 2004; Qiu et al. 2007: quite strong support), partly because they seemed to be intermediate in a progression between simple "algal"-like morphologies and the more complex land plants - they are filamentous, growth is by an apical cell, and they are oogamous. However, Turmel et al. (2006, 2007) found Zygnematales to occupy this position in a number of analyses based on complete chloroplast genome sequences - a commonly-found set of relationships was [<i>Chara</i> [<i>Chaetosphaeridium</i> [[<i>Zygnema</i> + <i>Staurastrum</i>] + Embryopsida]]] (see also  Chang &amp; Graham 2011: <i>Staurastrum</i> not included).  Similar relationships are commonly recovered, e.g. [<i>Nitella</i> [[<i>Spirogyra</i>, <i>Closterium</i>, <i>Chaetosphaeridium</i>, etc.] [<i>Coleochaete</i> + Embryopsida]]], (Finet et al. 2010), while B. Zhong et al. (2013a, b; c.f. Springer &amp; Gatesy 2014; Zhong et al. 2014a) found the variant relationships [Charales [Coleochaetales (inc. <i>Chaetosphaeridium</i>) [[Zygnematales + Desmidales] + Embryopsida]]] or [[Coleochaetales  + Zygnematales] Embryopsida], and similar relationships were found by Simon et al. (2006) and  Sayou et al. (2014). Although Springer and Gatesy (2014) found different topologies using other methods to analyse the data of Zhong et al. (2013a), Charales were never sister to embryophytes, and the relationships recovered around here are most often [[<i>Chlorokybus</i> + <i>Mesostigma</i>] [<i>Klebsormidium</i> [<i>Nitella</i> [[<i>Coleochaete</i> + <i>Chaetosphaeridium</i>] [[<i>Penium</i> + <i>Spirogyra</i>] + embryophytes]]]]], e.g. as found by Laurin-Lemay et al. (2012: q.v. for details) in a reanalysis of the data used by Finet et al. (2010) i.a. excluding contaminated data such as rotifer and diatom sequences; see also Cooper (2014) and Shen et al. (2017: evaluation of support). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Evidence for the sister group relationships of embryophytes and <i>Spirogyra</i> and its relatives is now quite strong (Leliaert et al. 2012: literature; Timme et al. 2012; see also Wodniok et al. 2011; Ruhfel et al. 2014; Wickett et al. 2014: transcriptome analyses), and chloroplast genome analyses of  Davis et al. (2014a), Civ&aacute;n et al. (2014) and Lemieux et al. (2016). The [<i>Penium</i> + <i>Spirogyra</i>] clade has a number of apomorphies, including the loss of cilia and also the loss of morphological complexity (Wodniok et al. 2011; Timme et al. 2012). </p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">For divergence within <i>Coleochaete</i> and its morphological variation, see Delwiche et al. (2002). Many genera of Desmidaceae are polyphyletic (Friedl &amp; Rybalka 2012 and references). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Clarifying the relationships of and within Zygnematales is clearly critical. However, whatever the sister-group relationships of embryophytes might be, <i>Chara</i> et al. are no longer likely candidates. Although this topology questions a scenario involving the evolution of ever more complex plant bodies, it is in line with chloroplast genome evolution, including that of the <i>tuf</i>A gene, which has moved to the nucleus, although it is present, if very odd, in <i>Coleochaete</i> (e.g. Baldauf et al. 1990; de Vries et al. 2016). The chloroplast ultrastructure of <i>Coleochaete</i> is in some ways similar to that of hornworts (Vaughn et al. 1992).</p>

This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).</p>	



<p style="text-indent: 30px;">All groups below are crown groups, nearly all are extant.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Clarke et al. (2011: other estimates, too) suggested an age for crown Embryopsida of (815-)670(-568) m.y., Cooper et al. (2012) estimated its age at (519-)493(-469) m.y., and Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013: including temporal constraints) an age of around (480.4-)475.3-474.6(-471) m.y. (see the constraint age in Heinrichs et al. 2007) and a stem age of around (962.5-)913, 911(-870) m.y.; the lowest crown date is around 439 m.y. (Magall&oacute;n &amp; Hilu 2009). An age of (629.5-)530(-449) m.y. is suggested in B. Zhong et al. (2014b: fossil calibration); see also P. Soltis et al. (2002: variety of ages, depend on calibrations).</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Many of the bolded characters in the characterization above are apomorphies of clades of subsets of streptophytes + embryophytes along the lineage leading to the embryophytes, not apomorphies of  crown-group embryophytes <i>per se</i>, and these latter are indicated by asterisks. Characters supporting relationships between Embryopsida and  subsets of streptophytes include many details of cell division, occurrence of  an apical cell in the gametophyte (perhaps),  numbers and types of introns in the chloroplast DNA, cilium ultrastructure, occurrence of sporopollenin (but in lower streptophytes it is associated with the inner wall of the zygote, not the walls of the spores - e.g. Wallace et al. 2011), retention  of the zygote on the haploid plant, and nrDNA in a single array; see also above.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Laenen et al. (2014) give ages and diversification rates for well over 150 major clades throughout land plants.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> The sporophytic generation can be thought of as being interpolated into a life cycle that was entirely haploid/gametophytic, with the exception of the zygote, rather than being the result of the divergence of initially morphologically similar diploid sporophytic and haploid gametophytic generations (e.g. Haig 2008, 2015; Gerrienne &amp; Gonez 2011). The <i>BELL1</i> homeobox gene may be involved in the interpolation of mitotic cell divisions between zygote formation and meiosis in early land plants (Horst &amp; Reski 2016: the gene is also known from <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, but this is not close). The more complex plant body would allow the production of spores, meiospores, the immediate products of meiosis, in larger numbers (e.g. Brown &amp; Lemmon 2011a; Qiu et al. 2012; Edwards et al. 2014). This change may have been driven by the unpredictability of fertilization (Haig 2015). (Interestingly, in <i>Coleochaete</i> the large, maternally-provisioned zygote may produce up to 32 zoospores, although exactly when meiosis occurs is unclear - Haig 2015.) Thus there may have been an initial development of a diploid spore-producing sporangium (= sporogonium), with the later elaboration of a full-blown free-living sporophyte in the polysporangiophyta, the vegetative body being an interpolation into the life cycle (e.g. Kaplan 1997: chap. 19; Kato &amp; Akiyama 2005; Qiu et al. 2012: extensive discussion; Ligrone et al. 2012b), the sporophyte becoming independent of the parental gametophyte (Haig 2015; Qiu et al. 2012). Some streptophytes and nearly all land plants have placental transfer cells or their equivalents either on the sporophytic or gametophytic sides or both; these have labyrinthine wall ingrowths that mediate an initial transfer of nutrients from the gametophyte to the sporophyte  (see Gunning &amp; Pate 1969; Ligrone et al. 1993: much detail; Kendrick &amp; Crane 1997; Hilger et al. 2002; Carapa et al. 2003; Vaughn &amp; Bowling 2008; Renzaglia &amp; Whittier 2013 for a tree). In both mosses and liverworts  gene families involved in meiosis are early expressed in the sporophyte, hence, perhaps, the lack of its extended growth (Frank &amp; Scanlon 2014); this is discussed further <a href="sporing.html#Polyspor">later</a>. However, our lack both of reliable knowledge of life cycles in most charophyte algae  (Haig 2010, 2015) and of the phylogenetic relationships of bryophytes, mosses, liverworts and hornworts (see below),  hamper our understanding of the events that led to the development of the alternation of generations in land plants.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A variety of spores, including permanent tetrads, may have been produced by protoembryophytic plants whose sporophyte was little more that these spores alone. Cryptospores, initially largely defined by what they were not (Strother 1991; Volkova et al. 2016 for meiosis), are known from the mid-Cambium onwards,  and cryptospores that  are like bryophyte spores appear in the middle Ordovician, about 40 m.y. later and ca 476 m.y.a. (e.g. Gray 1993; Wellman 2004a; Brown &amp; Lemmon 2011a; Gerienne et al. 2016 and references; for the evolution of the spore walls of land plants, see also Blackmore &amp; Barnes 1987). Fragments of plant bodies of very early land plants, perhaps liverworts, appear in late Ordovician rocks from Oman (Kenrick 2000; Wellman et al. 2003), while <i>Sphagnum</i>-like fossils, the earliest embryophyte vegetative remains discovered so far, have been found in Ordovician rocks ca 455 m.y.o. in North America (Graham et al. 2013, esp. Cardona-Correa et al. 2016). Edwards et al. (2014) discuss what they call cryptophytes, plants that cannot be confidently assigned to any extant group, from this period, and their cryptospores, which were hilate monads, dyads, and permanent tetrads. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For  a detailed study of the morphology of early land plants placed in a phylogenetic context, although some aspects of this are now dated, see Kenrick and Crane (1997). For many apomorphies of bryophyte groups and the early polysporangiophytes, see Ligrone et al. (2012a), and while characters are placed on a land-plant tree in Z.-H. Wang et al. (2017), several are in odd places, c.f. also the tree topology. Gerienne et al. (2016) characterize many embryophyte clades up to and including spermatophytes (but note that details of the topologies of both trees in their Fig. 2 differ from the topology of the relationships accepted here). Other features can be added to the characterization. L and D isomers of methionine are treated identically metabolically in liverworts, almost alone in land plants (Kenrick &amp; Crane  1997).  Members of Klebsormidiales, Coleochaetales, Desmidaceae and Zygnematales have pyrenoids, and so the loss of pyrenoids is likely to be an apomorphy for embryophytes (Cook 2004a, b). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the evolution of cell division, see the useful summary by Buschmann and Zachgo (2016). Brown and Lemmon (e.g. 1990, 2007; Brown et al. 2010) and others have unravelled some of the complexity of both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions in land plants, particularly extreme in liverworts; for meiosis, see also Renzaglia and co-workers (e.g. Renzaglia et al.  2000a, Renzaglia &amp; Garbary 2001). Although centrosomes and centrioles, which show vertical inheritance, are lost (Murata et al. 2007), similar structures (but they are not inherited) may develop during meiosis from microtubule organizing centres (MTOCs), and these vary considerably (Brown &amp; Lemmon 2007). Indeed, in <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> the nature of the MTOC changes during meiosis (Brown et al. 2007). In general, &gamma;tubulin, involved in the nucleation of microtubules, is highly migratory. Brown and Lemmon (1997, see also 2008) reviewed the distribution of the quadripolar microtubule system in land plants; it occurs in all three bryophyte groups, in lycophytes, and in Marattiales, at least. This system is linked with monoplastidy, the MTOC being associated with the plastid.  For variation in plastid number and possible correlations with patterns of microspore division, see Rudall and Bateman (2007). In streptophytes as a whole basal bodies develop de novo immediately prior to the formation of motile sperm cells (Wastenays 2002). Interestingly, the p.p.b. is sometimes absent, as in the protonema of at least some mosses, and even in megaspore development and in the endosperm of flowering plants, but in such situations elements of the preprophasic band apparatus may be present (Webb &amp; Gunning 1991;Buschmann &amp; Zachgo 2016 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Hodges et al. (2012) survey the evolution of land plant cilia in part focussing on the ciliome and the role it continues to play in land plant gametes even after the cilia are lost. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Pires and Dolan (2010) found that basic helix-loop-helix proteins, a class of transcription factors, diversified very early, at least as early as [mosses + the rest], while Volokita et al. (2010) discuss the <i>GDSL-lipase</i> gene family and its evolution.  RNA editing in which the organelle-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat proteins play an important role is restricted to Embryopsida (R&uuml;dinger et al. 2008). </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Sayou et al. (2014, the subsequent discussion should also be read) looked at the evolution of the <i>LEAFY</i> gene, usually in a single copy in embryophytes (but two in gymnosperms), yet variously involved in cell division and specification of floral identity. Its binding specificity is notably variable (promiscuous) in the hornworts, and although the evolutionary scenario suggested by Sayou et al. (2014) is based on the rather unlikely topology [hornworts [mosses [liverworts + vascular plants]]] (see also below), they suggest that whatever the topology, this promiscuity hypothesis is likely (see their Fig. S9). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In mosses, at least, the great majority - ca 95% - of genes are expressed in both generations (Sz&ouml;v&eacute;nyi et al. 2010; c.f. in part O'Donoghue et al. 2013), in line with the proposal by Banks et al. (2011) that some of the  genes involved in the patterning and differentiation of vascular tissue were present in the ancestral (gametophyte dominant) land plant and were recruited by the sporophytic generation.  Similarly, in the fern <i>Polypodium</i> ca 97% of the genes are expressed in both generations, only 10% of the genes differing in transcription levels between the two (Gigel et al. 2016). Frank and Scanlon (2014) proposed a model for sporophyte evolution that is similar to that for vascular tissue evolution. There do seem to be substantial differences between the two generations in expression of genes controlling apical meristem growth and auxin polarity  (e.g. Fujita et al. 2008; Sakakibara et al. 2008), and other studies found that over 12% of the transcriptome of the moss <i>Physcomitrella</i> switched in the transition from gametophyte to sporophyte, especially those genes involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism (O'Donoghue et al. 2013; see also Szovenyi et al. 2010). It is only in angiosperms that a substantial proportion (ca 25%) of genes are expressed in the sporophyte alone (Sz&ouml;v&eacute;nyi et al. 2010). Interestingly, in both angiosperms and <i>Physcomitrella</i> genes expressed in the gametophyte were younger than those expressed in the sporophyte (O'Donoghue et al. 2013; Cui et al. 2015; Gossmann et al. 2016). Floyd and Bowman (2007) discuss developmental changes possibly occurring at this node, and  Friedman et al. (2004) the evolution of plant development.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Much of interest is likely to come from the study of individual metabolic pathways and their control. Thus important signaling intermediates, the G-protein complex, is known from <i>Chara</i> and land plants (but not the green alga <i>Micromeris</i>), although elements of the pathway seem to be missing in some mosses and liverworts (Hackenberg et al. 2013). C3HDZ (class III homeodomain leucine zipper) genes, very important in development in euphyllophytes, etc., are also found in <i>Chara</i> (Prigge &amp; Clark 2006; Floyd et al. 2006; Vasco et al. 2016). Recently it has been found that microbial-type terpene synthase-like genes are commonly found in all embryophytes except seed plants (at 3/7, hornworts have the lowest proportion of such genes), and they are not found in streptophytes; all land plants also have another class of terpene synthase genes (Jia et al. 2016), and triterpenoids produced by CYP716 enzymes are found in all embryophytes, but not monocots (Miettinen et al. 2017). Some microbial terpene synthase genes are similar to those of fungi and others to bacterial genes (Jia et al. 2016), but other than the distinctive distribution of these genes, little is known about their evolution. Various classes of phosphoprotein phosphatases also have interesting distributions, with the ApaH phosphatases currently being known from streptophytes only, while the ALPH class is absent from land plants (Uhrig et al. 2012). Several copies of LATERAL ORGANS BOUNDARIES DOMAIN genes are to be found in bryophytes, and they are also also known from <i>Coleochaete</i> and <i>Spirogyra</i> (Chanderbali et al. 2015). <i>KNOX</i>1 and <i>KNOX</i>2  genes are unique to land plants, and <i>KNOX</i>1 regulates sporophytic meristems while <i>KNOX</i>2 suppresses the gametophytic developmental program in the sporophyte (Sakakibara et al. 2013). Two copies each of the plant homeobox <i>KNOX</i> genes, involved in meristem activity in vascular plants, and  the MADS-box <i>MIKC</i> genes, i.a. floral identity genes, are  found in mosses; subsequent duplication generated the diversity of these gene classes found in flowering plants in particular (Thei&szlig;en et al. 2001). I am not sure where such things should be placed on the tree...</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Yue et al. (2012) suggested that numerous genes, including those involved in many embryophyte functions like cuticle and lateral root formation, had been acquired by lateral transfer from fungi and bacteria (see also Emiliani et al. 2009). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">If a monophyletic bryophyte clade is sister to the polysporangiophytes/vascular plants (see below), then much of the above will need reevaluation, as will the evolution of <a href="sporing.html#Stomatophytes">stomata</a> and the complex <a href="sporing.html#Polyspor">sporophyte</a>.  A bryophyte clade could be characterized by having a single terminal sporangium, a proximal extension of the basal body, basal body length, and the angle of the spline with respect to the lamellar strip (= MTOC), etc. (for details, see e.g. Hodges et al. 2012, esp. Table 1), i.e. some embryophyte apomorphies become bryophyte apomorphies. The story as told  with bryophytes being paraphyletic - as here - emphasizes the progressive acquisition of features of vascular plants, e.g. of stomatal functions (Field et al. 2015b) and aspects of sporophyte development.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Problems of dealing with life on land centre on water loss, movement of water through the plant, protection from ultraviolet (UV-B) radiation (especially important for bryophytes), plant support, etc., and have shaped the evolution of both gametophyte and sporophyte (e.g. Watkins et al. 2007a, b; Del Bem &amp; Vincentz 2010; McAdam &amp; Brodribb 2011; Willis &amp; McElwain 2014; Graham et al. 2014; Proctor 2014; Raven &amp; Edwards 2014; Robinson &amp; Waterman 2014). See  also Bateman et al. (1998) and Hemsley and Poole (2004) for the physiology and ecology of early land plants. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">One of the major changes, or better, complex of changes, that facilitated the spread of land plants may have been the evolution of sporopollenin-covered spores from the sporopollenin-covered zygotes of their aquatic ancestors (Gray 1993; Blackmore &amp; Barnes 1987; Brown &amp; Lemmon 2011a). Sporopollenin, known from streptophytes like <i>Coleochaete</i> (Delwiche et al. 1989), became associated with the walls of the haploid spores by a complex process involving precocious initiation of cytokinesis (hence the often quadrilobed, quadripolar microtubule system of many bryophytes), acceleration of meiosis, delay in wall deposition, etc., a mixture of heterochrony and heterotopy (Brown &amp; Lemmon 2011a). The composition of sporopollenin is remarkably stable in land plants, and the sporopollenin of the walls around lycophyte fossil spores ca 310 m.y.o., of extant lycophytes and the embryos in some Charales is quite similar (Fraser  et al. 2012), although the sporopollenin of conifers, at least, may differ.  Homologues of just about all genes involved in pollen wall development in <i>Arabdiopsis</i> are to be found in <i>Selaginella</i> and <i>Physcomitrella</i>, emphasising the fundamental similarity of angiosperm pollen and moss spores (Wallace et al. 2011).   Wellman (2004b) noted that sporopollenin deposition was associated with white line-centred lamellae. </p> 


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Lignin, integral to the support and water-conducting facilities of vascular plants in particular, and flavonoids, involved in protection againt UV radiation, are synthesised by pathways that both use phenylalanine lysase (PAL) in an early step. Emiliani et al. (2009) suggested that embryophytes acquired this gene via lateral transfer from a bacterium; they found that it was also present in fungi, but absent from <i>Nostoc</i>. Delwiche et al. (1989) record lignin-like compounds (positive Maule reaction) from <i>Coleochaete</i> and Ligrone et al. (2008) lignin-related compounds from <i>Nitella</i>, so exactly where PAL moved into the streptophyte clade is uncertain. Much of the pathway by which lignin is synthesized in vascular plants is found already in mosses (G&oacute;mez-Ros et al. 2007; Z. Xu et al. 2009, see also Guo et al. 2010), but in some cases pathways in mosses and liverworts may differ (see below under stomatophytes). S lignin, made up of syringyl units, has been found in some liverworts and is scattered elsewhere in vascular plants; in flowering plants it is very common (Z. Xu et al. 2008Li &amp; Chapple 2010; Espi&ntilde;eira et al. 2010; see also G&oacute;mez-Ros et al. 2007). Isoprenoids (xanthophylls and tocopherols) that protect against photo-oxidation and other insults of a dry, high light environment are widely distributed in land plant and in some of their aquatic relatives, although some carotenoids involved in these functions  may have evolved in land plants (Esteban et al. 2009).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Raven and Edwards (2014) list estimates of the net photosynthetic rates for bryophytes and other early land plants. It has recently been suggested that back in the Late Ordovician ca 450 m.y.a. and with an atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration about eight times today's levels, land plants, bryophytes and lichens, supported a level of chemical weathering two to three times that of today's vegetation (Porada et al. 2016). Such high levels are likely to have been temporary as embryophytes spread and nutrients became limited and  nutrient recycling in the developing soil/humus layers increased, but they may have helped precipitate glaciation (Porada et al. 2016). For photosynthesis in bryophytes and early embryophytes, see Graham et al. (2014) and other articles in Hanson and Rice (2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Reproductive Biology.</u> For a discussion about various aspects of sexual and asexual reproduction in the gametophytic generation of bryophytes, the latter very common and occuring in a variety of ways, see Maciel-Silva and P&ocirc;rto (2014). Since gametophytes spread vegetatively, it causes complications  for sporophyte formation; if selfing takes place, the sporophyte is homozygous. Given this vegetative spread, dioecy is only a partial solution since sperm cannot swim very far, but dwarfed males that are epiphytic on the females have evolved in a number of taxa  (Haigh 2016). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Chlorophyllous spores are found in a few bryophytes, and germination in such spores is precocious (endosporic).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Some caterpillars of Micropterigidea, a jawed, lepidopteran clade that is perhaps Jurassic in age and sister to all other leps, are detritivores, but others eat mosses (e.g. <i>Atrichum</i>) and especially liverworts (Imada et al. 2011; Regier et al. 2015 and references; see also <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.nhm.ac.uk/entomology/hostplants/',600,500)">Hosts</a>, consulted iii.2014), although they also eat angiosperms (Davis &amp; Landry 2012 and references). On balance, evidence suggests that  the <i>Araucaria</i>-eating jawed moths, Agathiphagidae, are sister to Micropterigidae (Regier et al. 2015; Kristiansen et al. 2015; c.f. Heikkil&auml; et al. 2015). For the host plants of other jawed moths, see also Nothofagaceae. Caterpillars of Mnesarchaeidae, members on a basal glossatan clade, live in silk tunnels and eat mosses and liverworts, as well as fern sporangia, etc., their sister taxon, Hepialoidea, much more species rich, also are concealed feeders, but they eat just about everything (Regier et al. 2015). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Associations between embryophytes and fungi, initially with the gametophytes of the former, were established very early in the Silurian/Devonian (Selosse &amp; Tacon 1998; Redecker et al. 2000b; Nebel et al. 2004; K&ouml;ttke &amp; Nebel 2005; see also Strullu-Derrien et al. 2014b).  At least three genes involved in the establishment of mycorrhizae were found in the common ancestor of land plants, although the <i>DM13</i> gene in particular seems to have other functions in many mosses (B. Wang et al. 2010, commentary by Bonfante &amp; Selosse 2010). Strigolactones, involved in the establishment of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal associations at least, are known from some streptophytes (Charales) and seem initially to have been involved  the control of rhizoid elongation (Delaux et al. 2012); a number of other genes involved in mycorrhizal establishment have a similar ancestry (Delaux et al. 2015). A karrikin receptor complex is involved in the initial interaction between plant and fungus (karrikin and strigolactone both have a butenolide element), and this complex is found widely in embryophytes (DeLaux et al. 2012; Gutjahr et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Glomeromycota, Mucoromycotina, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, the major groupings of fungi that form mycorrhizal associations with embryophytes, are all associated with liverworts (Read et al. 2000; Duckett et al. 2006b; Pressel et al. 2010; Bidartondo et al. 2011; Field et al. 2015c; Wei&szlig; et al. 2016). Bidartondo et al. (2011; see also Pressel et al. 2010) found that <i>Endogone</i>-like fungi (Mucoromycotina) also formed associations with <i>Treubia</i>, <i>Haplomitrium</i>, some hornworts, etc., and surmised that this might be the original land plant-fungus association (see also Rimington et al. 2014), or both glomeromycotes and mucoromycotes might have been involved (Field et al. 2015c, d). Indeed, Field et al. (2015c) looked at the changing interactions between liverwort and both glomeromycotes and mucoromycotes as evident in the efficiency of acquisition of both phosphorus and nitrogen by the fungus in the context of almost four-fold decrease in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from the Paleozoic to the present. Associations between liverworts and basidiomycetes (especially Serendipitaceae) and ascomycetes are likely to be secondary (Bidartondo &amp; Duckett 2009; Wei&szlig; et al. 2016; Field et al. 2015d). Given the complex patterns of association of extant bryophytes with fungi (Field et al. 2015c), even if Mucoromycotina were the first fungal associates of liverworts, the establishment of plant-fungus relationships there may be independent of those in other plants. Others have suggested that arbuscular mycorrhizal Glomeromycota were found in the earliest land plants (literature in van der Heijden et al. 2015). The fungus may move to the liverwort from a tracheophyte (Ligrone et al. 2007) or in the opposite direction (Pressel et al. 2010: see also Bidartondo &amp; Duckett 2009). Colonization of the plant is of the <i>Paris</i> type, with extensive intracellular hyphal growth producing coils, but sometimes neither arbuscules nor vesicles (Field et al. 2015d). For the (mostly ascomycetous, but some Sebacinales-Serendipitaceae) endophytic fungi to be found in mosses and liverworts, see Stenroos et al. (2010),  Pressel et al. (2010) and Wei&szlig; et al. (2016).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are similarities in the microbiomes of streptophytes and bryophytes, in particular, similar nitrogen-fixing and methanotrophic organisms occur in both, and this has implications both for the evolution of the atmosphere and for the organisms involved (Knack et al. 2015). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u>  Details of gene and genome evolution in embryophyte plastids are given by  Jansen et al. (2007), A. M. Magee et al. (2010),  Wicke et al. (2011), Civ&aacute;n et al. (2014) and Lemieux et al. (2016). Compared with their sister groups, the [Zygnematales + Desmidales] clade, the chloroplast genome in basal land plants is relatively stable (e.g. Lemieux et al. 2016). The <i>trn</i>L<sub>UAA</sub> and <i>trn</i>F<sub>GAA</sub> genes are not associated in other green plants (Quandt et al. 2004). Details of the evolution of the chloroplast <i>trn</i>S and <i>trn</i>N genes in embryophytes are complex (Knie et al. 2014). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Most bryophytes have small mitochondrial genomes and little variation in gene order compared with mitochondria in vascular plants (Y. Liu et al. 2014a); for the evolution of the mitochondrial genome in basal land plants, see Knoop (2013).  For intron distributions in mitochondrial genes, see Dombrovska and Qiu (1994), Qiu et al. (1998), and Regina et al. (2005). <i>trn</i>S(gcu) and <i>trn</i>N(guu) genes occur in the mitochondria of many streptophytes and also in liverworts; the former gene is also found in the mitochondria of  the [monilophyte + lignophyte] clade, but not in Gnetales.</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">See Wicke et al. (2011) for nuclear ribosomal DNA organization and Leitch and Leitch (2013) for the small nuclear genomes of bryophytes (club mosses not sampled).</p>

Komatsu et al. (2014; see also Doi et al. 2006) discuss chloroplast movement, mediated by a single copy of the blue-light sensitive phototropin gene, in land plants. For the evolution of rhizoids and rhizoid-like structures, see Duckett et al. (2014), also <a href="sporing.html#Stomatophytes">below</a>. The sporangium develops from tiers of four cells (quadrants) which divide periclinally producing an outer amphithecium and an inner endothecium; the major groups of bryophytes differ in how the capsule wall and spores develop from these cells (Ligrone et al. 2012a for a summary). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> See Kenrick and Crane (1997), Nishiyama and Kato (1999) and Shaw and Renzaglia (2004) for early literature on bryophyte relationships. The three groups are usually found to be monophyletic, although this was sometimes not so for liverworts (Bopp &amp; Capesius 1998; Quandt &amp; Stech 2003, and references). There are four competing hypotheses of relationships between bryophytes, and relationships here are currently somewhat problematic (see also Cooper 2014).</p> 

<p>1. Many studies support the set of relationships [liverworts [mosses [hornworts + vascular plants]]] (e.g. Kenrick &amp; Crane 1997; Goffinet &amp; Shaw 2009; Shaw et al. 2011 for literature; Shen et al. 2017: evaluation of support for two hypotheses); Qiu et al. (2006) confirmed these relationships using three different data sets. This may be the most supported hypothesis of relationships at present (see also Lewis et al. 1997; Kelch et al. 2004; Wolf et al. 2006: many analyses, whole chloroplast genomes]; Qiu et al. 2007; S. Li et al. 2013; Y. Liu et al. 2014b: mitochondrial nucleotide and amino acid data, all other relationships very poorly supported; Magall&oacute;n et al. 2013, 2016), and it is tentatively followed here. Dombrovska and Qiu (1994) had earlier outlined several lines of evidence such as the content of the inverted repeat and intron distributions that were consistent with the idea that liverworts are sister to all other land plants (see also Qiu et al. 1998b for mitochondrial introns; Antonov et al. 2000: cp rDNA ITS). Kelch et al. (2004), using structural characters of the plastome, and Groth-Malonek et al. (2004, not all analyses; see also Knoop 2005), looking at <i>trans</i>-splicing mitochondrial introns, also suggested the same position for liverworts (see also Rydin &amp; K&auml;llersj&ouml; 2002 and Karol et al. 2010, but neither in all analyses). Consistent with this hypothesis, the distribution of an extension of the chloroplast inverted repeat placed hornworts as sister to tracheophytes, as did the distribution of cell wall xylans (Carafa et al. 2005), and this position is also favoured by an analysis of cpITS spacer sequences (Samigullin et al. 2002) and a complete plastome analysis (Karol et al. 2010).</p>

<p>2. In an analysis of whole chloroplast genomes, the relationships [liverworts, mosses [hornworts + vascular plants]] were obtained, although a [liverwort + moss] clade was sometimes found (Ruhfel et al. 2014). This latter clade was also recovered in the study by Finet et al. (2010: hornworts not sampled), in some analyses in Karol et al. (2010) and in B. Zhong et al. (2013b), where <i>Anthoceros</i> was sometimes sister to tracheophyta, sometimes sister to Lycopodiales, u.s.w.. In the chloroplast proteome analysis of Shanker et al. (2011: c.f. position of <i>Huperzia</i>) this group was part of a monophyletic bryophytes. Nishiyama et al. (2004) also proposed that the three bryophyte groups form a single clade; 51 genes from the entire chloroplast sequence were included, but taxon sampling was poor, e.g., no lycophytes were included.  A similar grouping was also found in an analysis of the <i>trn</i>L intron (Quandt et al. 2004) and in another study that looked at many genes but with very skimpy sampling, that of Goremykin and Hellwig (2005). In the chloroplast genome Bayesian MCMC analysis of Civ&aacute;n et al. (2014) relationships were [[hornworts [mosses + liverworts]] [clubmosses, etc. + the rest]], although in a concensus tree [liverworts + hornworts] were sister to other embryophytes, within which relationsdhips were pretty much scrambled.  In a more extensive analysis of chloroplast genomes, Lemieux et al. (2016) recovered the relationships [[mosses + liverworts] [hornworts + the rest], although support for the position of the sole hornwort included, <i>Anthoceros</i>, was weak.</p>

<p>Cox et al. (2014) noticed that trees based on protein coding sequences and trees based on the proteins they coded differed in their topologies, and they suggested that there may have been synonymous substitutions in the sequences; they, too, argued strongly for the monophyly of bryophytes. A [liverwort + moss] clade was also recovered by Wickett et al. (2014) in transcriptome analyses, and in many analyses there, too, bryophytes (as [hornworts [mosses + liverworts]]) were monophyletic; the topology in hypothesis 1 was never recovered. </p>

<p>3. Mitochondrial sequence data sometimes placed hornworts as sister to all other land plants (for references, see Stech et al. 2003); Sayou et al. (2014) found this position in their analysis of the <i>LEAFY</i> gene, and it also appeared in the analyses of Rai and Graham (2010), but it may be a rooting issue there. Renzaglia and Garbary (2010) considered that the evidence for the hornwort basal hypothesis was compelling, and several other studies have recovered this topology (Shanker et al. 2011 for references). </p>

<p>4. Mosses are sister to all other land polants in the analyses of Floyd et al. (2006, 2014) and Vasco et al.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence and Distribution.</u> Villarreal A. et al. (2015b: q.v. for dates) discuss evolution in the complex-thalloid clade, i.e. Marchantiopsoda; overall molecular evolution (plastid and mitochondria) was slow compared to that of other hepatics, except in <i>Cyathodium</i>, an annual (a reversal), but morphological evolution was less so. Given the topology of the tree (e.g. the position of <i>Neohodgsonia</i> is important), where features of the carpocephalium and those involved in the differentiation of the thallus - the variation is extensive -  are to be paced on the tree is unclear, but the pattern of gains and losses will be complex (Villareal A. et al. 2015b). Heinrichs et al. (2007) discussed the evolution of the ca 4,500 species of leafy liverworts, suggesting possible divergence times for the clades (see also Newton et al. 2007; Coooper et al. 2012), and Wilson et al. (2007a, b) discuss the diversification of Lejeuneaceae in particular. Much of the diversification of Porellales and Jungermanniales, both leafy liverworts epiphytic on bark and leaves of flowering plants, has occurred since the evolution of angiosperms (Ahonen et al. 2003; Forrest &amp; Crandall-Stotler 2004), although the clades involved are (much) older (Cooper et al. 2012). Indeed, although many liverwort families had diverged  by the end of the Cretaceous, they have diversified considerably since (Cooper et al. 2012). Note that although ages in Newton et al. (2007), Heinrichs et al. (2007) and Cooper et al. (2012) can differ greatly, the overall conclusions of the authors differ less; additional dates may be found in these publications.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For characters of Haplomitriopsida, see Duckett et al. (2006a).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Understanding the ecophysiology of the first liverworts is a challenge. Field et al. (2012, 2014 and references) discuss details of the nature of the mutualistic association between fungus and plant in some liverworts, including Haplomitriopsida (see also Ligrone et al. 2007; esp. Field et al. 2015c). The association of Mucoromycotina with <i>Haplomitrium</i> benefits both partners, and since <i>Haplomitrium</i> lacks rhizoids the fungus is particularly important in nutrient uptake (Field et al. 2014). Field et al. (2015c) looked at the changing interactions between liverwort and both glomeromycotes and mucoromycotes in the context of almost four-fold decrease in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from the Paleozoic to the present. Interestingly, the efficiency of acquisition of both phosphorus and nitrogen by the fungus decreased with decreasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the former (and when the liverwort has relationships with both kinds of fungi) but increased in the latter - so why <i>Haplomitrium</i> should be associated with glomeromycotes alone is unclear (Field et al. 2015c).</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">The echlorophyllous <i>Cryptothallus</i> [= <i>Aneura</i>] <i>mirabilis</i> is the only mycoheterotrophic liverwort, indeed, it is the only mycoheterotrophic bryophyte. It may grow up to 20 cm below the surface of <i>Sphagnum</i>-dominated peat bogs, and it is associated with hyphae of the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete <i>Tulasnella</i> which is simultaneously associated with <i>Betula</i> or <i>Pinus</i> and from which the liverwort imdirectly obtains its carbon (Wickett et al. 2008 and references; Merckx et al. 2013a). Extant <i>Marchantia</i>, at least, is mixotrophic (Hata et al. 2000; Graham et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Quite a number of liverworts, including epiphytes, are dessication tolerant, although most lack internal water-conducting cells (Ligrone et al. 2000).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Reproductive Biology.</u> The dead, pegged rhizoids to be found in marchantialean liverworts with complex thalli may help ensure the water supply to the stalked carpocephala (Duckett et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> For a summary of herbivory and galling, including examples from the Middle Devonian where some cells of the fossils perhaps contained oil and represent defence against herbivory, see Labandeira et al. (2013). Caterpillars of Micropterigidae, a basal, jawed, lepidopteran clade, are common on <i>Conocephalum conicum</i> in Japan, and this group also includes species eating other liverworts elsewhere, also angiosperms, detritus, etc. (Imada et al. 2011; Ragier et al. 2015 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u>  All the  major groupings of fungi that form mycorrhizal associations with plants are associated with liverworts (Read et al. 2000; Duckett et al. 2006b; Pressel et al. 2010; Bidartondo et al. 2011; Field et al. 2014, 2015c). Some liverworts in the basal pectinations are associated with both Glomeromycotina and Mucormycotina (Kottke &amp; Nebel 2005; Field et al. 2014; Rimington et al. 2014), but this association may subsequently have been lost (Duckett et al. 2006b). In Jungermanniopsida-Jungermanniales associations with ascomycetes are more than 250 m.y.o. (Pressel et al. 2008), and the fungus may move from these liverworts to seed plants (Pressel et al. 2010: see also Bidartondo &amp; Duckett 2009). Thus the ascomycete <i>Rhizoscyphus</i> [= <i>Hymenoscyphus</i>] <i>ericae</i> is very commonly an associate of the hair roots of North Temperate Ericaceae, and it also forms mycorrhizal associations with Jungermanniales-Schistochilaceae and other leafy liverworts; colonization of the liverwort is by their rhizoids (Duckett &amp; Read 1995; Upson et al. 2007; Pressel et al. 2008). These indirect associations with seed plants have little necessarily to do with early liverwort-fungus associations (e.g. Duckett &amp; Read 1995). Members of a clade of Sebacinales-Serendipitaceae are associated with liverworts (Wei&szlig; et al. 2016), and this is also likely to be a relatively recent connection. Epiphytic Porellales lack fungus associations, and in general epiphytic or epilithic liverworts are often not associated with fungi (Pressel et al. 2010), a tendency also evident in angiosperms.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The mycoheterotrophic <i>Cryptothallus</i> [= <i>Aneura</i>] <i>mirabilis</i> is associated with the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete <i>Tulasnella</i> (Kottke &amp; Nebel 2005; Wickett &amp; Goffinet 2008; Wickett et al. 2008; Imhof et al. 2013). <i>Cryptothallus</i> may be nested within <i>Aneura</i>, and the latter is also associated with basidiomycetes (Pressel et al. 2010). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Blasia</i> (Marchantiopsida) fixes nitrogen  by virtue of of its association with <i>Nostoc</i> (Rai et al. 2000) but does not form any associations with fungi (Field et al. 2015c).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u>  Endopolyploidy has rarely been detected in liverwort nuclei (Bainard &amp; Newmaster 2010a, b), although the nuclei of the smooth rhizoids of at least some liverworts are highly endopolyploid (Duckett et al. 2014).</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Marchantiopsida have lost to ability to carry out RNA editing of the organellar genes (R&uuml;dinger et al. 2008). There is also substantial variation in the size of the nuclear genome, that of Marchantiopsida being particularly small, but few species have been examined (Villareal A. et al. 2015b).</p>
 
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the chloroplast genome of <i>Aneura mirabilis</i>, see Wickett et al. (2008). The genome is more or less normal in size, although it has functionally lost around 25 genes, in line with gene losses in parasitic angiosperms (see also Bellot &amp; Renner 2015).</p> 


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b>  Details of meiosis, whether there is one or more chloroplasts, etc., vary considerably in liverworts, and some derived taxa are quite like vascular plants in these respects (Brown &amp; Lemmon 2008, 2013). There is monoplastidic meiosis in <i>Monoclea</i>, <i>Haplomitrium</i> and <i>Blasia</i> (Brown &amp; Lemmon 2011a), but there is also polyplastidic meiosis as well as intermediates. Buschmann  et al. (2016) discuss microtubles and cell division in <i>Marchantia</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For apical cell division, see Piatkowski et al. (2013), for the development of the  unicellular elaters, see Renzaglia et al. (1997) and Crandall-Stotler and Stotler (2000), for spore walls, see Wellman et al. (2003), and for rhizoids, see Duckett et al. (2014). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Phylogeny.</u> Morphological studies indicated that <i>Sphaerocarpos</i> might be sister to all other liverworts (Crandall-Stotler &amp; Stotler 2000). However, molecular data suggest rather different relationships, and it is now included in Marchantiopsida (see also Forrest &amp; Crandall-Stotler 2004, 2005; He-Nygr&eacute;n et al. 2004; Qiu et al. 2006), although the long branches associated with <i>Haplomitrium</i> and <i>Treubia</i> cause their position in the tree to be somewhat migratory. He-Nygr&eacute;n et al. (2006: 3 chloroplast and 1 nuclear genes, morphology) outline the phylogeny and classification of liverworts, finding a basic structure [Treubiopsida [Marchantiopsida + Jungermanniopsida]]. This basic topology is confirmed by Forrest et al. (2006: five genes, all three compartments, good sampling, esp. of thalloid liverworts, 2015),  Volkmar and Knoop (2010) and Cooper et al. (2012). N.B.: Treubiopsida = Haplomitriopsida. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Marchantiopsida include <i>Blasia</i>, <i>Sphaerocarpos</i>, etc., although support for the inclusion of the former in this clade could be improved (but c.f. some analyses in Forrest &amp; Crandall-Stotler 2004, esp. 2005; Qiu et al. 2007: <i>Blasia</i> sister to other Marchantiopsida; see also He-Nygr&eacute;n et al. 2004). Cooper et al. (2012; see also Forrest et al. 2015) also found <i>Blasia</i> - with <i>Cavicularia</i> - to be sister to the other Marchantiopsida.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Jungermanniopsida, simple-thallus groups are paraphyletic with respect to the speciose and monophyletic leafy liverworts, within which <i>Pleurozia</i> is sister to the rest (e.g. He-Nygr&eacute;n et al. 2004; Davis 2004: grouped with some simple-thalloid genera; Cooper et al. 2012: extensive study). These general relationships were also recovered by Qiu et al. (2007). Leafy liverworts have been studied by Cooper et al. (2011: the speciose Lepidoziaceae), and  Gradstein et al. (2003) and  Yu et al. (2013), both Lejeunaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Clarke et al. (2011) suggested an age for this clade of (750-)632(-548) m.y., Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013) an age of around 458.3 m.y.; other estimates are (748-)703(-658) m.y. (Heckman et al. 2001: protein sequence analysis), a little over 500 m.y. (Villarreal &amp; Renner 2014), (580-)496(-412) m.y. (Zimmer et al. 2007), ca 450 m.y. (Thei&szlig;en et al. 2001), and  (550.8-)487.6(-435.6) m.y. (B. Zhong et al. 2014b) and ca 470 m.y.a. (Y. Liu et al. 2014a); see also Hedges et al. (2004) and P. Soltis et al. (2002).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> When mosses were thought to be sister to vascular plants the conducting tissue in the centre of the stem in some moss gametophytes was homologized with the vascular tissue in the sporophytes of vascular plants (e.g. Mishler &amp; Churchill 1984, 1985; Mishler et al. 1994). However, this was in part due to the way in which characters describing conductive tissue were conceptualized; there may be little reason to consider the conductive tissues of mosses and those of polysporangiophytes as having much similarity other than that due to their similar functions (e.g. Ligrone et al. 2000, 2002). Ligrone et al. (2002) found no great similarity between the water conducting cells of <i>Takakia</i>, the hydroids of other mosses, and the conducting tissues in <i>Haplomitrium</i> and metzgerialean liverworts (see also Doyle 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">However, recent work may modify such interpretations. Thus B. Xu et al. (2014) found that similar NAC transcription factor family genes were expressed during the development of hydroids of mosses and xylem of vascular plants, despite the difference in the generation in which they were expressed and in morphology (neither pitting nor lignification in hydroids), i.a. inducing cell death in both. Such NAC genes are uncommon in liverworts. Similarly, the formation of both sporophytic root hairs in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and gametophytic rhizoids in <i>Physcomitrella</i> involves the same regulatory gene network, perhaps independent recruitment and/or some kind of heterochrony/topy (Menand et al. 2007; Pires &amp; Dolan 2010; Pires et al. 2013; see also Sz&ouml;v&eacute;nyi et al. 2010); Jones and Dolan (2012), Kenrick and Strulla-Derrien (2014), and Hwang et al. (2017) Tam et al. (2015) also discuss the evolution of root hairs and rhizoids. The latter found that the development  of "tip-growing" cells like rhizoids, caulonema cells and root hairs was controlled by a similar auxin-regulated network. Whether such findings can be extended to liverworts is of considerable interest.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">If the three groups of bryophytes form a clade (see <a href="sporing.html#Embryophytes">above</a>), then interpretating the evolution of such features as stomata, cell division and the sporophyte shoot meristem becomes challenging, particularly if liverworts are sister to other bryophytes (e.g. Frank &amp; Scanlon 2014, see  <a href="sporing.html#Polyspor">below</a>). That aside, optimization of such distinctive and important features as the presence of a sporangium with a seta and columella, stomata, trilete spores, etc., is not easy even if bryophytes are a paraphyletic group. Stomata, although placed at the node above, are absent from some of the basal clades of mosses, and their morphology can be quite distinctive (see below; Merced &amp; Renzaglia 2013; Haig 2013), perhaps suggesting their independent origin within mosses. The pores of the mucilage clefts of hornwort gametophytes are probably not homologous with stomata (Adams 2002; Adams &amp; Duggan 2008). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Stomata may not be involved in gas exchange in the context of photosynthesis in either mosses or hornworts, rather, they may facilitate the drying out of the capsule and hence aid in spore dispersal (Duckett et al. 2009; Pressel et al. 2011; see also Merced &amp; Renzaglia 2013; Merced 2015; Chater et al. 2016, 2017). If this was the original function of stomata (McAdam &amp; Brodribb 2012a, b), then the central role that stomata now play in photosynthesis in vascular plants becomes a spectacular exaption.  Stomata may also originally have increased transpiration and so improved the supply of nutrients to the sporangium (e.g. Haig 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">It has been suggested that the stomatal behaviour of vascular plants differs from that of bryophytes (McAdam &amp; Brodribb 2011, esp. Fig. 4), for instance, abscisic acid plays a crucial role in control of stomatal opening only in seed plants, even if similar genes involved in abscisic acid metabolism are found throughout land plants (McAdam &amp; Brodribb 2012; McAdam et al. 2016). On the other hand, Chater et al. (2011) suggested that stomata of the moss <i>Physcomitrella</i> responded to at least some environmental stimuli rather like those of flowering plants (O'Donoghue et al. 2013), abscisic acid being involved in both (see also Beerling &amp; Franks 2009; Chater et al. 2014; references in Raven &amp; Edwards 2014; Lind et al. 2015). Genes involved in the signalling pathway in guard cell opening/closing are known from liverworts (Chater et al. 2014; Lind et al. 2015), but McAdam et al. (2016) suggest that in bryophytes such genes are primarily involved in spore dormancy. Similar genes are involved in stomatal development in both vascular plants and some mosses (see also O'Donoghue et al. 2013), although whether the stomata of <i>Sphagnum</i> are like those of other mosses in such respects is unclear (Merced 2015). Field et al. (2015b) found  that stomatal density and aperture size in taxa from mosses and hornworts were largely unresponsive to changing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. However, the physiology of stomatal functioning is unclear (Roelfsema &amp; Hedrich 2016). For the literature on stomatal patterning, i.e. the development of stomata and their associated/surrounding cells, of extant and extinct stomatophytes, see Rudall et al. (2013a), Caine et al. (2016), etc.; stomata are separated by one or more epidermal cells, and some of the genes involved in <i>Physcomitrella</i> retain their function when moved to <i>Arabidopsis</i>. For the molecular basis of stomatal development, see Peterson et al. (2010) and  Chater et al. (2017). There is more discussion about stomata under <a href="sporing.html#ExtTrac">extant tracheophytes</a>, but as is clear from work on features like C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, independent acquisitions of the "same" feature can result in remarkable similaritiea at the molecular level. And of course the absence of a firm phylogeny for bryophytes does not make understanding stomatal evolution easier (see also Lind et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Fossils of leaves with distinctive cell structure remarkably similar to that of extant <i>Sphagnum</i> are known from the Ordovician deposits in Wisconsin - they are the earliest known vegetative remains of an embryophyte and are dated at 455-454 m.y. (Cardona-Correa et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Mosses in China showed weaker latitudinal diversity gradients than did liverworts, perhaps because the former  can handle a wider diversity of enviornments than the latter, a number of which are epiphyllous and need humid conditions; moss diversity was linked in part to local habitat heterogeneity (S.-B. Chen et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Polytrichopsida/Dicranidae/haplolepidious taxa are a diverse but species-poor group compared to the ca 12,000 species of Hypnanae/hypnalian pleurocarpous/arthrodontous mosses (Cox et al. 2010); Newton et al. (2007, 2009; see also B. Zhong et al. 2014b) give dates for many clades. There is strong geographical signal in the phylogeny of Polytrichopsida, clades being largely south or north temperate (Bell &amp; Hyv&ouml;nen 2010: intergeneric hybridization?). Within the speciose pleurocarpous mosses - about 40% of all mosses - diversification seems to have been early and rapid, clades diverging in the early Cretaceous, but since then there has been semi-stasis (K&uuml;rschner &amp; Parolly 1999; Shaw et al. 2003b; Newton et al. 2006, 2007), although there may also have been more recent ([post-]Cretaceous) diversification as well. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Since some combination of <i>Andreaea</i>, <i>Takakia</i> and <i>Sphagnum</i> and immediate relatives are at the base of the moss phylogenetic tree and all have distinctive morphologies, apomorphies for mosses as a whole are unclear. Huttunen et al. (2013: focus on Plagiothecaceae) optimize the evolution of a number of features in both Hypnales and Hookeriales.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Dessication tolerance is common in mossses, even in taxa like <i>Sphagnum</i>. The antheridia remain functional if they were dried slowly and then were subsequently rehydrated (Stark et al. 2016 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Mosses are important components of tundra and boreal forest biomes (for the bryosphere, see Lindo &amp; Gonzalez 2010) and can make up a substantial proportion of the biomass in boreal forests (Wardle et al. 2013).  Hummock-forming <i>Sphagnum</i> in particular is a major element of the boggy vegetation in such areas in communities from poor fens to the forest floor. Indeed, rich fens in such areas  commonly progress from so-called brown mosses like <i>Drepanocladus</i> and <i>Calliergon</i> and a pH of ca 6 to <i>Sphagnum</i>-dominated bogs with a pH of 4 or a little more - oligotrophification and acidification is mediated by <i>Sphagnum</i>, a process that proceeds fastest in cool, wet conditions (Kuhry et al.  1993).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The ecophysiology of <i>Sphagnum</i>, often dominant in  in tundra and boreal biomes, has been studied in some detail. Particularly in exposed areas, damage from high-light conditions becomes important, as with other mosses, and drying out may also occur - but  water reduces CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion by a factor of 10<sup>4</sup>. However, methanotropic bacteria live in the hyaline cells in the leaf, and they prefer damper conditions; they oxidize methane from decomposing peat, producing CO<sub>2</sub> which is then utilized by the plant. This can provide up to a third of its CO<sub>2</sub> supply. All  23 of the species of <i>Sphagnum</i> in a site in Finland could convert methane into a source of CO<sub>2</sub>, so this capability may be ubiquitous in the genus (in <i>Scorpidium scorpioides</i>, which grows in similar habitats, the figure is up to 70% - Larmola et al. 2010; H&aacute;jek 2014.) For the microbiome of <i>Sphagnum</i>, integral to the functioning of the organism and its ecosystem, see Bragina et al. (2014). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Different species of <i>Sphagnum</i> tend to grow in hummocks and in hollows of the bogs, and these preferences correlate with different growth rates, rates of peat breakdown (Turetsky et al. 2008), phylogeny, etc., while the differences in the rate of peat breakdown can be linked to variation in carbohydrate metabolism within the genus (Turetsky et al. 2008). There is also extensive pH variation in these bogs, and different species prefer different pHs, but here there is no large-scale correlation with phylogeny (Johnson et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Sphagnum</i>-dominated fens in northern Alberta may not be very productive in terms of gross primary productivity. However, respiration tends to be low, the plants start photosynthesizing early in the year, etc., so overall net carbon productivity may be higher than in, for example, <i>Carex</i>-dominated rich fens (Flanagan 2014; see also Ragoebarsing et al. 2005). Breakdown of moss peat in general, and <i>Spagnum</i> peat in particular, tends to be slow (Turetsky et al. 2008). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The discovery of <i>Sphagnum</i>-like fossils in Ordovician rocks ca 455 m.y.o. suggests that the ecological equivalents of modern <i>Sphagnum</i> peatlands may have been around for a long time, and this has considerable implications for carbon fixation and sequestration in general, the evolution of the biota associated with the moss in particular, etc. (Graham et al. 2013, esp. Cardona-Correa et al. 2016). Carpenter et al. (2015) found spores of <i>Stereisporites</i> to be very common in fire-prone heathlands in Central Australia 75-65.5 m.y.a., and they linked them with <i>Sphagnum</i>, while Daly et al. (2011) suggest that <i>Sphagnum</i>-type mosses were components of peats produced by mire vegetation in northern Alaska ca 60 m.y.a. that later were converted to coal. However, the beginning of the diversification that gave rise to extant species of  peat-forming <i>Sphagnum</i> has been dated to as late as the mid-Miocene ca 14 m.y.a. (Shaw et al. 2010a; Shaw &amp; Devos 2014), indeed, the species that are major accumulators of peat today make up only a clade, albeit a major clade, within <i>Sphangum</i>, i.e. not including either subgenus <i>Rigida</i> or the segregate genera (Shaw et al. 2016). A genome duplication in <i>Sphagnum</i> dated to (221-)197(-173) m.y.a. might have been involved is its rise to dominance in peatlands (Devos et al. 2016) - and this gets us back to the dating of <i>Sphagnum</i> diversification, the fossil record of the genus, and where it might grow when the earth was much warmer than it is now - even at the poles.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In northern ecosystems a few species of feather mosses, pleurocarpous Hypnales like <i>Hylocomium splendens</i> and <i>Pleurozium schreberi</i>, form close associations with the cyanobacterium  <i>Nostoc</i>, nitrogen moving from the latter into the former (Bay et al. 2013); sufficient phosphorus and in particular molybdenum is essential (Rousk et al. 2016). However, the further movement of nitrogen in the ecosystem into the ecosystem can be unclear (Rousk et al. 2013; Lindo et al. 2013; Rousk et al. 2016 and literature).</p>  

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Gametophyte vascularization is particularly well developed in Polytrichopsida, and the leptoids  apparently transport organic molecules (Ligrone et al. 2000).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Reproductive Biology.</u> For the recurrent evolution of dioecy in mosses - at least 133 times - see McDaniel et al. (2013). Dioecy may be accompanied by sexual dimorphism of the plants. Reversal to hermaphroditism is less common, but diversification may be higher in hermaphroditic clades (McDaniel et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">When the antheridium dehisces, the contents are released as a single sperm mass, and subsequently the individual sperm disperse (Stark et al. 2016 and references). Very small arthropods are attracted to volatile compounds produced by <i>Ceratodon purpureus</i> and are involved in the transfer of sperm to the archegonia (Rosenstiel et al. 2012; see also Cronberg et al. 2006).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a comprehensive study of the evolution of capsule shape in mosses, see Rose et al. (2016). At least sometimes shape changes are associated with changed speciation rates, as is the adoption of the pleurocarpous habit.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The stomata of <i>Sphagnum</i> lack both pores and airspaces immediately under the guard cells; the stomata help the capsule to dry out, and as it buckles the stomium pops off and the spores are shot into the air (Duckett et al. 2009).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Bay et al. (2013) discuss associations between <i>Nostoc</i> and some pleurocarpous mosses in boreal forests; other blue-green algae are also involved (Rousk et al. 2013 for a review). Functional mycorrhizal associations, i.e. associations that are involved in the exchange of nutrients, are very rare in mosses, and most moss-fungus associations involve parasitic fungi (Read et al. 2000; Davey &amp; Currah 2006). Fot the possibility that <i>Buxbaumia</i> is mycoheterotrophic, see Imhof et al. (2013). Other endophytic fungi may also affect moss growth and ecology (Read et al. 2000; Davey &amp; Currah 2006). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Genomes in mosses are small, 1C values being less than 1.4 pg (Bennett &amp; Leitch 2005); I do not know what the sizes are in liverworts, etc.. The rate of molecular evolution is slow in the three genes from all three compartments examined (Sten&oslash;ien 2008: liverworts, hornworts, and lycophytes not examined).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Endopolyploidy is widespread in mosses, although not occuring in <i>Sphagnum</i> (Bainard &amp; Newmaster 2010a, b). However, genome duplications are reported from this genus, (Devos et al. 2016). Aside from suggesting that such duplications might have been involved is its rise to dominance in peatlands, as in many other land plants, the genes retained after this event  are similar to those retained after similar events - i.e. involved in ion channels or signal transduction pathways, although <i>Physcomitrella</i> differs somewhat in this respect (Sz&ouml;v&eacute;nyi et al. 2015; Devos et al. 2016, and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is a very large (ca 71 kb) inversion of the chloroplast genome in Funariaceae (which includes <i>Physcomitrella</i>), Disceliaceae, and Encalyptaceae, all Funariidae, although Gigaspermaceae lack this inversion (Goffinet et al. 2007). For the loss of the PEP &alpha; subunit-encoding <i>rpo</i>A gene in many mosses, see Goffinet et al. (2005); it is absent in <i>Tetraphis</i> and <i>Diphyscium</i>, present  in <i>Buxbaumia</i> and <i>Polytrichum</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Yue et al. (2012) found a number of genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> that had moved there by lateral transfer from fungi and bacteria; how widely they might be distributed in mosses is unknown. </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry &amp; Morphology.</b> As moss rhizoids branch, they become progressively narrower, about as  wide as a fungal hypha; for the distinctive nature of their cytoplasm, see Field et al. (2015d). The stomata of <i>Sphagnum</i> lack a stomium (), while in those of <i>Funaria</i>, at least, the stomium is encircled by a single cell that has two nuclei (Sack &amp; Paolillo 1983; Merced &amp; Renzaglia 2016: spacing), however, in other mosses the stomata have two guard cells (Merced &amp; Renzaglia 2013). For spore wall morphology of <i>Sphagnum</i>, see Brown et al. (1982); some layers, e.g. the translucent layer, may be unique. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a general entry into the literature, see Goffinet et al. (2004) and for information about pleurocarp mosses, see Newton and Tangney (2007); for sporogenesis, see Brown and Lemmon (1984: <i>Andreaea</i>, 2013), for apical cell division, see Piatkowski et al. (2013), for sieve elements/leptoids, see Scheirer (1990), and for placental tissue, see Carapa et al. (2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Relationships between clades at the base of the moss tree remain unclear. <i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Andreaea</i> and <i>Takakia</i>, the latter initially thought to be a liverwort (see Renzaglia et al. 1997), are all in this area, <i>Sphagnum</i> and <i>Takakia</i> perhaps being sister taxa and <i>Andreaea</i> sister to remaining mosses (e.g. Cox et al. 2004; Qiu et al. 2006, 2007: rather strong support; Volkmar &amp; Knoop 2010; Shaw et al. 2010b [perhaps]; S. Li et al. 2013: 9 loci;  Rose et al. 2016). However, <i>Takakia</i> has a region in the cpITS3 sequence that is very like that of all other land plants but is deleted in other mosses, from this evidence alone, <i>Takakia</i> might be sister to all other mosses (Samigullin et al. 2002). Indeed, recent work suggests relationships may be [<i>Takakia</i> [<i>Sphagnum</i> [[<i>Andreaea</i> + <i>Andreaeobryum</i>] [<i>Oedopodium</i> [[Polytrichopsida + Tetraphidopsida] Bryopsida]]]]] (Chang &amp; Graham 2009, esp. 2011, 2014; Rose et al. 2016: but c.f. in part above); a [<i>Takakia</i> + <i>Sphagnum</i>] clade was recovered only in some reconstructions. The odd, almost leafless <i>Buxbaumia</i> may be sister to all other Bryopsida.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">See Shaw et al. (2010b; also Shaw et al. 2003a for morphology, 2010a, 2016) for relationships in the <i>Sphagnum</i> et al. clade. The very distinctive <i>Sphagnum leucobryoides</i> (= <i>Ambuchanania</i>) was described only some twenty five years ago (Yamaguchi et al. 1990), and it and a very few other species of <i>Sphagnum</i> (placed in genera like <i>Flatbergia</i>) are outside <i>Sphagnum</i> s. str., the bulk of the clade.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within the remaining mosses, Chang and Graham (2009, esp. 2011) and S. Li et al. (2013) found <i>Oedopodium</i> to be sister to the others. See Cox et al. (2010) for a phylogenetic study of mosses focusing on genera and families. Wahrmund et al. (2010) used a new mitochondrial locus to investigate relationships among mosses; the position of <i>Timmia</i> was particularly unclear. </p>


 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">For relationships in  Dicranidae (haplolepidious mosses), see Stech et al. (2012). Bell et al. (2007) discuss the phylogeny of the early diverging pleurocarp clades, and adjust their taxonomy accordingly, while Buck et al. (2005) discuss the phylogeny of Hookeriales. Most branch lengths in the speciose Hypnales are short (Huttunen et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The age of this clade may be (399-)306, 248(-173) m.y. (Villarreal &amp; Renner 2012) or  261-186 m.y. (Laenen et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b>  <u>Divergence and Distribution.</u> Most diversification within Anthocerotopsida has taken place within the last 100 m.y. or so, or even within the Caenozoic  (Villarreal &amp; Renner 2012; Villarreal et al. 2015a, q.v. for dates, etc.).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Neochromes, a chimaeric photoreceptor in which red-sensing phytochrome and blue-sensing phototropin are fused into a single molecule, have been found in all hornworts sampled (<i>Leiosporoceros</i> not studied: F.-W. Li et al. 2014).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Pyrenoids (for which, see Hanson et al. 2014) vary considerably in morphology and have evolved five times or more in the hornworts between 101 and 18 m.y.a. (and also subsequently been lost); their repeated evolution in Anthocerotopsida seems to be another example of a "tendency" (Villarreal &amp; Renner 2012). I.a. they increase the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> around the chloroplasts and so increase the efficiency of photosynthesis (E. Smith &amp; Griffiths 1996).</p></p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the association of hornworts with the nitrogen-fixing <i>Nostoc</i>, see Rai et al. (2000), and for what is known about <i>Nostoc</i> and nitrogen fixation, see Santi et al. (2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> <i>Endogone</i>-like fungi (Mucoromycotina) are associated with some hornworts (Bidartondo et al. 2011; Rimington et al. 2014), and are quite common there, as are Glomeromycota (Pressel et al. 2010). The two may form mycorrhizal associations with the same species, but whether either or both mycorrhizal association was ancestral in the group is unclear (Desir&ograve; et al. 2013); the latter association, at least, seems rather casual (Pressel et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> In most taxa <i>Nostoc</i> enters the gametophyte through mucilaginous clefts (Adams 2002; Adams &amp; Duggan 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> The extensive RNA editing in <i>Anthoceros</i> and its relatives is at codon positions that are otherwise universally conserved in land plants (Duff et al. 2007). There seems to have been between 1-6 duplications in each of the three groups of GDSL lipases somewhere around here (Volokita et al. 2010). </p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Anthoceros</i> has lost the chloroplast <i>rps</i>15 gene (Mart&iacute;n &amp; Sabater 2010) and the IR has expanded somewhat (Villarreal et al. 2013). </p>
 
 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">There has been extensive loss of protein-coding genes in the mitochondrion, i.e. ca 1/2, versus less than 1/3 in other land plants (Y. Liu et al. 2014b). <i>Leiosporoceros</i> has an intron in the mitochondrial <i>nad</i>5 gene, as do  <i>Anthoceros</i> and immediate relatives (Villarreal et al. 2013).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The cell walls of spores and their elaters contain xylans, an important polysaccharide in secondary cells walls of vascular plants, but unknown in other bryophytes (Carafa et al. 2005). The elaters are multicellular structures of tapetal origin, quite unlik those of <i>Equisetum</i> (Pacini &amp; Franchi 1991). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">See also Ligrone et al. (2000) for general information, Villarreal et al. (2010) for a summary of our understanding of hornworts, Vaughn et al. (1992) for the distinctive and variable chloroplasts and Brown and Lemmon (2013) for sporogenesis; for antheridia, see Duff et al. (2004) and Cargill et al. (2005).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Relationships within hornworts are still unclear in part. <i>Leiosporoceros</i> may be sister to all other hornworts, although the extensive RNA editing in other members of the clade obscures this position in some analyses (e.g. Duff et al. 2007); it has many distinctive features (see above). See also Stech et al. (2003), Duff et al. (2004) and Villarreal and Renner (2012) for relationships.  <i>Anthoceros</i> and its possible segregate <i>Folioceros</i> are sister to remaining hornworts, and they have black or dark spores, etc. (in this they are like <i>Leiosporoceros</i>). Villarreal and Renner (2014) discussed the limits of and relationships around <i>Nothoceros</i>. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Several classifications of this clade have appeared recently (Frey &amp; Stech 2005; Stotler &amp; Crandall-Stotler 2005; Duff et al. 2007); they tend to be rather elaborate; see S&ouml;derstr&ouml;m et al. (2016) for a classification down to the level of species.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Note that the number of spores produced per sporangium is roughly the same here as in bryophytes (Qiu et al. 2012). For a comprehensive study of the early evolution of land plants with apomorphies at all levels and incorporating fossil members, see e.g. Kenrick and Crane (1997; also Kenrick et al. 2004; Doyle 2013; etc.). Characters that can be pegged to this node and those to be linked with the tracheophyte node need to be separated. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The exact relationship between the sporophytes of polysporangiophytes and bryophytes is unclear (e.g. Shaw et al. 2011), especially given the uncertainties in the phylogeny. The stalk of a moss capsule may not be strictly homologous to the branching sporophyte axis of the polysporangiophytes (Kato &amp; Akiyama 2005; Qiu et al. 2012). Sterilization of the sporangial axis or simple elaboration of a bryophyte sporangium leading to the evolution of a branched sporophyte are ideas that have been suggested, but prolongation of embryonic growth is perhaps more likely (Tomescu et al. 2014). Frank and Scanlon (2014) found that there was expression of meiosis gene families early in the development of both <i>Physcomitrella</i> (see also O'Donoghue et al. 2013: carbohydrate metabolism genes) and <i>Marchantia</i> sporophytes, which would perhaps make their extended growth unlikely, however, in the stem apex of maize and in the gametophyte apex of mosses, but not liverworts, similar patterning gene families were upregulated (see also Fujita et al. 2008; Sakakibara et al. 2008). A scenario for the evolution of a complex sporophyte may involve delayed expression of genes involved in meiosis, which would allow for indeterminate development of a sporophyte in which these patterning genes were expressed (Frank &amp; Scanlon 2014). Genes expressed in the gametophyte may be essential for the subsequent elaboration of the sporophyte.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some  sporophytes of early polysporangiophytes were very small. Those of the Silurian cooksonioids in particular are 1 mm or substantially less across and were probably dependent physiologically on the gametophyte (Rothwell 1995; Boyce 2008b; see also Edwards et al. 2014). Conversely, some early gametophytes were quite elaborate structures, although different in morphology from the sporophytes, and they even had conducting tissue, stomata, a cuticle, and were apparently homoiohydric - i.e. they had many features now associated with the sporophyte (Remy &amp; Haas 1991; Edwards 1993; Edwards &amp; Richardson 2004; Taylor et al. 2005; Gerrienne &amp; Gonez 2011; Ligrone et al. 2012a). A stage in the evolution of vascular plants may involve an ancestor in which the generations were pretty much isomorphic. Indeed, a largely isomorphic alternation of generations represented by some of the plants from the Lower Devonian Rhynie Chert of some 410 m.y.a. figures largely in attempts to understand the evolution of land plant life cycles (Niklas &amp; Kutschera 2009, 2010). Some early vascular plants had multicellular stem apices (Hueber 1992). The sequence may be as follows: Gametophyte only free living, sporophyte unbranched, dependent on the gametophyte &#8594; gametophyte only free living, sporophyte branched, dependent on the gametophyte &#8594; generations &plusmn; isomorphic, both free living  &#8594; sporophyte dominant, gametophyte free-living &#8594; sporophyte dominant, gametophyte dependent on sporophyte (see also Tomescu et al. 2014; c.f. Qiu et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae have been found in the axes of <i>Aglaophyton major</i> from the early Devonian ca 400 m.y.a. (Remy et al. 1994). A variety of fungal associations have been found in fossils of early polysporangiophytes, whether in gametophyte or sporophyte, and sometimes the fungi pervade the whole plant (e.g. Strullu-Derrien et al. 2014b). Because true roots had not yet evolved, they are best called paramycorrhizal associations (Kenrick &amp; Strullu-Derrien 2014; for early fungal associations, see also  Rimington et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Silvestro et al. (2015) estimate that vascular plants are (449-)433.5(-424 )m.y.o., and other estimates are broadly similar, e.g. 454-416 m.y. (Clarke et al. 2011) and (463.5-)429(-400) m.y. (B. Zhong et al. 2013b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Pryer et al. (2004b) provide a useful summary of the evolution of vascular plants; see also e.g. Kenrick and Crane (1997; also Doyle 2013; etc.). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Proctor (2014: p. 66) emphasized that the endohydrous and homoiohydrous vascular plant clearly did not evolve as such (c.f. the birth of Athena), but that elements of the "vascular-plant package" were to be found in extant ecto- and poikilohydrous plants. </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Edwards (1993; Edwards &amp; Richardson 2004; see also Niklas 2015 for some cautionary comments) reviewed the anatomy of the vegetative parts of sporophytes of early land plants.  For the evolution of xylem and the relation between details of cell anatomy and cell wall chemistry and water transport, plant support, etc., see  Sperry (2003 and references); lignin may initially helped in keeping tracheary elements open, only later becoming involved in plant support.  Cichan (1986) and Wilson (2015) and references relate details of xylem anatomy and water transport, linking extinct and extant plants; woods of early vascular plants may have been quite efficient in conducting water, although susceptible to embolism/cavitation (see Schenk et al. 2017 for the role of  lipid surfactants in the xylem in preventing embolisms). Tracheophytes all have some kind of roots, although these have almost certainly evolved more than once (e.g. Raven &amp; Edwards 2001; Pires &amp; Dolan 2012). Tomescu et al. (2014) and Proctor (2014) also discuss the evolution of roots in vascular plants; roots would allow plant size to increase by providing stability and facilitating increased water uptake. For the evolution of root hairs, see the discussion <a href="sporing.html#Stomatophytes">above</a>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Early vascular plants are likely to have had a variety of associations with fungi (e.g. see Rimington et al. 2014). Field et al. (2015c) looked at nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by glomeromycote and mucoromycote fungi associated with liverworts in the context of changing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, and the changing patterns that they found should be borne in mind here, too.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Note that Polysporangiophyta technically lack vascular tissue of any sort, and so they include tracheophytes; for the two broken out (and protracheophytes, with hydroid and leptoid conducting cells, paratracheophytes and eutracheophytes also separated), see Gerienne et al. (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Clarke et al. (2011) suggested an age for the clade of (456-)446(-425) m. years. Somewhat younger ages for vascular plants, (434.3-)424-421.6(-416.2),  can be found in Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013), (492.9-)428.8(-400.1) m.y.  in B. Zhong et al. (2014b), while Lars&eacute;n and Rydin (2015) suggest ages  of ca 432 m.y., largely in line with fossil-based ages (Kenrick et al. 2012) which were used in the calibrations (a similar age in Villarreal &amp; Renner 2014). However, P. Soltis et al. (2002: variety of estimates) suggested an older crown age of (813-)603(-393) m.y. ago.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Hilate/trilete spores that do not remain as tetrads appear in the Early Silurian ca 443 m.y.a. and may mark the origin of vascular plants (Steemans et al. 2009; Kenrick et al. 2012; Gerienne et al. 2016 and references), but note that the first appearance of trilete spores is placed at the stomatophyte node here.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Rothfels et al. (2015a) suggested that lycopods, ferns and other plants with abiotically mediated fertilization evolved reproductive incompatability only slowly, hence  they have an intrinsically slow rate of speciation.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The basic pattern of early development of the sporophyte, exoscopic or endoscopic, is outlined by  Niklas and Kutschera (2009). Their scenario involves both gains and losses of endoscopic development; the optimisation here involves parallel gains, but is equally parsimonious.  For sporopollenin in land plants, see 
<a href="sporing.html#Embryophytes">above</a>. Baucher et al. (2007) discuss vascular evolution, Johnson and Renzaglia (2009) that of the embryo, while Arens et al. (1998: <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/IB181/VPL)">Virtual paleobotany laboratory</a>) is a valuable web resource.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">As Ambrose and Vasco (2015) emphasize, apical meristems of vascular plants as a whole are best thought of as being multicellular structures with cytohistochemical zonation (for plasmodesmata, see Imaichi &amp; Hiratsuka 2007, c.f. interpretation of apical meristems there). However, there is some discussion as to the occurrence of apical cells in polysporangiophytes. Stems have an apical meristem, either of a single cell or group of cells (e.g. Kato &amp; Akiyama 2005), and it is commonplace to make a distinction between tracheophytes with meristems of a single cell and those with meristems of several cells (Imaichi 2008). Interestingly, the expression patterns in the single apical cells of <i>Selaginella</i> and <i>Equisetum</i> are quite different (Frank et al. 2015). This may suggest that the apical cells in ferns s.l. and <i>Selaginella</i> evolved independently - or that the differences between the two reflect the long period they have been separated, some 400 m.y. or more (see above for ages; Frank et al. 2015). Details of the construction of the apical meristem varies within lycophytes (see below) but not in the other main groups, and they correlate with the richness of plasmodesmatal connections between the cells: many plasmodesmata - meristem a single cell, few plasmodesmata - meristem a group of cells (Imaichi &amp; Hiratsuka 2007). Fern apical meristems for the most part are multicellular, the apical initial(s) only rarely dividing (Ambrose &amp; Vasco 2015; Vasco et al. 2016). D'Amato and Avanzi (1968; see also Gifford 1985) noted that the apical cells of <i>Equisetum</i> early became polyploid and did not divide (c.f. in part Gifford et al. 1979). See also <a href="Cycadales.html#extseedplants" target="home">elsewhere</a>. Interestingly, even in fern gametophytes the apical cell is functional for a short while only, and then the apical region converts to a multicellular meristem (Takahashi et al. 2009, 2015 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Roots are thought to have evolved two or more times in vascular plants (e.g. Raven &amp; Edwards 2001). Within angiosperms, gene families involved in root development are conserved, the great majority being found in all six angiosperms studied, and this is true of genes involved in root development in <i>Arabidopsis</i> in particular (Huang &amp; Schiefelbein 2015). Remarkably,  around 82% of the gene families expressed in all angiosperm roots are also expressed in <i>Selaginella</i>, even root cap-associated genes. Although details of the functional similarities of these genes is unknown, there may have been parallel evolution of root-associated genes in lycophytes and  other vascular plants, or the dissimilarity of roots of lycophytes and other vascular plants was, at one time at least, not that great, some sort of roots occuring in the ancestor of extant vascular plants (Huang &amp; Schiefelbein 2015; see also Hetherington et al. 2016). At least some details of the molecular development of root hairs are similar across all vascular plants, with <i>ROOT HAIR SPECIFIC</i> genes interacting with others to stimulate root hair development (Hwang et al. 2017), with similarities perhaps extending still more broadly (see above). Root hairs may have beeen able to differentiate from almost any cell, i.e., there were no trichoblasts, visibly distinguishable precursors of a root hair cells (Clowes 2000), however, whatever the root hair distribution pattern, there is  specificity of gene expression because of a conserved transcription factor and <i>cis</i>-element (D. W. Kim et al. 2006).</p>
 
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Floyd and Bowman (2006), Boyce (2008a), Boyce and Leslie (2012) and others emphasize the diversity of leaf morphologies, growth forms, etc., to be found in non-angiospermous plants in general. However, all leaves, whether megaphylls or microphylls, can be thought of as structures with "a determinate growth programme [added] to the indeterminate apical growth programme" (Harrison et al. 2005b: p. 509). Similar but independently recruited developmental mechanisms may be involved in the evolution of microphylls and megaphylls (Harrison  et al. 2005b), as in many other aspects of  evolution in land plants (Pires &amp; Dolan 2012). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Zimmermann's (1930, see also 1952, 1965) telome theory that euphylls are the result of overtopping, planation and webbing of a stem/branch system, has been influential, although in detail it is no longer tenable (Kenrick 2002; Beerling &amp; Fleming 2007). It has been suggested that the development of euphylls or megaphylls, often quite large structures the vascular supply of which is associated with gaps in the central stele, is quite different from that of microphylls, vascularized structures, but not associated with leaf gaps in the central steele (e.g. Bower 1935; Floyd &amp; Bowman 2006).  The leaves of lycophytes are characterized by having an intercalary meristem and being supplied by a single vein that does not leave a gap in the central stele when it departs (see Kaplan 1997, vol. 2: chap. 16, vol. 3: chap. 19, 2001 for leaf morphology), while  megaphylls are determinate organs with ad/abaxial identities; vascular bundles supplying them leave "gaps" in the central stele when they depart (see e.g. Sporne 1965, but c.f. Kaplan 1997, vol. 3: chap. 19, 2001 in particular, see also Harrison et al. 2005; Boyce 2005a: summary of earlier literature, 2008; Tomescu 2008, 2009; Sanders et al. 2007, 2009; Corvez et al. 2012). </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">However, details of the evolution of the euphylls that are supposed to characterise  the [Monilophyta + Lignophyta] clade are unclear. Schneider et al. (2009: p. 461 and references) suggest that mega/euphylls arose once, and can be characterized by apical/marginal growth, apical origin of the venation, determinate growth, etc., or independently in seed plants and monilophytes, and an estimated 3-6 times in the latter alone, and perhaps elsewhere as well (Floyd &amp; Bowman 2007), or four independent origins of megaphylls in ferns/monilophytes, progymnosperms, and seed plants by the end of the Devonian (D.-M. Wang et al. 2015;  see also Kenrick &amp; Crane 1997; Boyce &amp; Knoll 2002; Osborne et al. 2004; Gensel &amp; Kenrick 2007; Tomescu 2009; Niklas &amp; Kutschera 2009; Sanders et al. 2009; Galtier 2010; Corvez et al. 2012: at least two origins; Tomescu et al. 2014).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Indeed, Harrison et al. (2005b), Floyd et al. (2014), Vasco et al. (2016) and others are chipping away at understanding the developmental background of euphylls or megaphylls or whatever they are called, indeed, of leaves in general. Some of the genes involved in megaphyll formation may have evolved long before megaphylls appeared, but with different functions then,  (e.g. Beerling 2005a, b; Floyd 2006; Vasco et al. 2016 and references). Floyd et al. (2014) place the origin of the post-translational negative regulators of apical meristem and leaf development, the LITTLE ZIPPER (ZPR) proteins, at the [Monilophyta + Lignophyta] node; they are part of the C3HDZ (class III homeodomain leucine zipper) stable of genes, which may initially have been expressed in sporangia in embryophytes im btyophytes on up (Vasco et al. 2016 and references). After gene duplication of the C3HDZ gene in the [Monilophyta + Lignophyta] clade, one of the copies degenerated and became the ZPR gene, and it and C3HDZ genes together were involved in the evolution of euphylls. Floyd et al. (2014) could not find ZPR genes in lycophytes.  </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">However, there may be more commonality between microphylls and megaphylls than might appear, and Vasco et al. (2016) suggest that C3HDZ genes may have been coopted in both megaphyll and microphyll development. Both megaphylls and microphylls can be thought of as modified sporangia. In lycophytes one of a pair of sporangia became a microphyll (see also Crane &amp; Kenrick  1997) with C3HDZ genes being expressed in their development, while in the [Monilophyta + Lignophyta] clade more complex telome systems make up the leaf and C3HDZ genes are involved in leaf dorsiventrality, being expressed throughout the young primordium, but only on the adaxial surface and involved in the development of dorsiventrality later on (a neofunctionalization - Vasco et al. 2016; see also Scarpella &amp; Meijer 2004 for the radial/dorsiventral sequence). Overall, there is a very complex pattern of gains, modifications, and losses of genes (Vasco et al. 2016).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Kenrick et al. (2012) discussed the effect of vascular plants on the carbon cycle. There are broad correlations between atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and stomatal size that have important implications for plant productivity, transpiration, and rock weathering. When the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of the atmosphere is low, leaves tend to have higher densities of smaller stomata, allowing more CO<sub>2</sub> to diffuse into the leaf, when concentrations increase, relationships are the reverse (e.g. Franks &amp; Beerling 2009). It has also been suggested that CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, guard cell size, and genome size can be linked, the first and last being broadly correlated over the last 400 m.y. (Haworth et al. 2011), although genome size reconstructions (Fig. 4) and some other aspects of this story (see also Franks et al. 2012) are difficult to understand. Within vascular plants there is a great range of relative pore area (pore area/total guard cell + pore area), that of <i>Huperzia</i> and <i>Nephrolepis</i> being much lower than that of flowering plants, and there is even greater variation in the rate of stomatal opening (Franks &amp; Farquhar 2006). For water use efficiency throughout the Phanerozoic, see Franks and Beerling (2009a) and  Assouline and Or (2013: a different interpretation for higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations). The carbon cycle was further affected by the evolution of vascular plants with well developed secondary thickening, whether producing mostly bark or both bark and wood (see <a href="Cycadales.html#SeedplantsEcolPhys" target="home">elsewhere</a>).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The response of photosynthesis to red light and passive stomatal control of leaf hydration are perhaps best tagged to this node (see above: McAdam &amp; Brodribb 2011).  Thus the mechanism of stomatal closure in ferns is like that of lycophytes rather than that of seed plants (McAdam &amp; Brodribb 2011, 2012, 2013; see also Haworth et al. 2011, 2013; McAdam et al. 2016); it is passive, and abscisic acid is not immediately involved. Watkins and Cardel&uacute;s (2012) noted that in some respects epiphytic ferns, at least, are ecologically more like angiosperms than terrestrial ferns, using water quite efficiently (and having very low hydraulic conductivity). However, one of the ways in which ferns and lycophytes, whether gametophyte or sporophyte, can grow in drier conditions is by being dessication tolerant, even if the mechanism of stomatal control is overall similar to that in ferns growing in more mesic conditions (McAdam &amp; Brodribb 2013). Note that there seems to be no movement of the stomatal aperture in <i>Equisetum</i>, where it is permanently closed, and this may also be the case in <i>Psilotum</i> - although there is movement in Lycopodiales (Cullen &amp; Rudall 2016; Roelfsema &amp; Hedrich 2016). Indeed, in ferns, at least, part of the pathway  involved in stomatal closing in seed plants is involved in spore dormancy (as perhaps in bryophytes) and in the determination of the sex of the gametophyte, and there, too, there is antagonism between giberellic acid and abscisic acid (McAdam et al. 2016; see Cullen &amp; Rudall 2016; Chater et al. 2017 and references for the evolution of stomatal patterning and development).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Ferns, gymnosperms and lycophytes tolerate nutrient-poor (but sometimes rich in non-essential minerals) conditions, perhaps the ancestral conditions for many of them (Page 2004). The evolution of some genes in plants involved in mycorrhizal associations that facilitate phosphorus uptake by the plant may be pegged to this node (Delaux et al. 2015). Note, however, that advantages to plants in which mycorrrhizae were first established and advantages to extant plants may differ (Maherali et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Mycorrhizal associations with AM <i>Glomus</i> are common in members of this clade, and the basic kind of mycorrhizal associations seems to be the <i>Paris</i> type where the hyphae are intercellular, forming coiled structures between the plant cells (F. A. Smith &amp; Smith 1997; Winther &amp; Friedman 2008), although the   <i>Arum</i> type, with extensive intercellular hyphal growth and intracellular arbuscules and vesicles is common in vascular plants (Field et al. 2015d). In <i>Ophioglossum</i> and <i>Botrychium</i>, some Lycopodiaceae, <i>Psilotum</i>, and a few ferns and angiosperms, etc., associations are variously with the echlorophyllous gametophytic and/or sporophytic stages (Winther &amp; Friedman 2007, 2008, 2009; Hynson et al. 2013).  Around 10% of all vascular plants are  mycoheterotrophic for all or part of their life cycles (Leake &amp; Cameron 2010), a nuber driven by the number of species in Orchidaceae ( 27,800) nearly all of which have such associations with fungi; there are perhaps 1,000 species in the Lycopodiales and Monilophytes combined (Winther &amp; Friedman 200). Full mycoheterotrophy, known from ca 880 species (this number includes ferns, etc., that have echlorophyllous gametophytes alone), has evolved 46 or more times, including some cases in liverworts (Merckx et al. 2013a).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Chromosome numbers in heterosporous vascular plants seem to be lower than those of homosporous plants.  Thus in pteridophytes (including lycophytes) n = 57 on average, but in heterosporous water ferns n = 13.7, in angiosperms n = 16, in homosporous <i>Lycopodium</i> chromosome numbers are higher than in heterosporous <i>Isoetes</i> and <i>Selaginella</i>, and chromosome numbers in gymnosperms are on average also low (Barker 2013) - not that some flowering plants in particular do not have high chromosome numbers, but the average is low. In ferns, genome duplication followed by gene silencing but not chromosome loss  may be responsible for the high numbers (Haufler 1987; Barker 2013 and references), while in angiosperms in particular there is extensive gene and genome remodelling after polyploidization events (see <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#GenGen">elsewhere</a>).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Three new families of transcription-associated proteins may have evolved in this general area (Lang et al. 2010: hornworts not included; see also Zhu et al. 2012, Lang et al. not cited). For genome sizes in monilophytes and lycophytes, see Nakazato et al. (2008) and Leitch and Leitch (2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the evolution of the chloroplast genome in other than seed plants, see Wolf and Karol (2012). Chloroplast genomes seem particularly labile in taxa ouside the angiosperms (Guisinger et al. 2011 for  references). The order of genes in the mitchondrion is relatively invariable in bryophytes but much more variable in vascular plants (Y. Liu et al. 2014a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Condensed tannins are polymerized in a chloroplast thylakoid-derived tannosome (Brillouet et al. 2013).  In extant vascular plants, lignins are rich in guaiacyl units (Harris 2005), and the evolution of the cinnamyl/sinapyl alcoholase gene family involved in the synthesis of the hydroxycinnamyl alcohol monomer units (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, guaiacyl, syringyl) that ultimately constitute lignin can perhaps be pegged to this node (Guo et al. 2010; c.f. G&oacute;mez-Ros et al. 2007; Zu et al. 2009). Some xylans may be restricted to the sporophyte (Eeckhout et al. 2014).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For programmed cell death in vascular plants, which is involved in tracheid development, for instance, see van Hautegem et al. (2015). Edwards (2003) and Edwards et al. (2003) examined conducting cells of early tracheophytes and compared the morphologies of the cells involved with those of the bryophytes. For a general discussion on the evolution of water-conducting cells, with particular attention to wall sculpturing and its nature, see especially Kenrick and Crane (1991, 1997), Cook and Friedman (1997), Friedman and Cook (2000) and Edwards et al. (2006). However, understanding the fossil record is difficult in part because our knowledge of the development and nature of the wall thickening even of extant vascular plants is surprisingly poor, and exactly where in the wall lignin is deposited affects water conductance (Sperry 2003). The developmental control of conducting tissue in moss gametophytes and vascular plant sporophytes suggests that at one level they may not be that much different (see also <a href="sporing.html#Stomatophytes">above</a>). For a general comparison of tracheary cells, see Bailey and Tupper (1918).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Secondary thickening has evolved more than once and the pattern of secondary growth varies considerably. The vascular cambium is usually unifacial, producing xylem internally only, and there are usually no anticlinal divisions of the cambial cells. Sphenophyllales alone outside the seed plant lineage may have developed a bifacial vascular cambium (e.g. Rothwell et al. 2008b; Spicer &amp; Groover 2010; Hoffman &amp; Tomescu 2011). Strullu-Derrien et al. (2014a) examined the hyudraulic properties of a very early wood with secondary thickening. It is unclear exactly when/in what clade an endodermis evolves (Raven &amp; Edwards 2001: p. 385).  </p>

Soltis et al. (2002).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For the early evolution of Lycopodiopsida, which have a rich fossil record, see Gensel and Berry (2001), Wellman et al. (2009), Ambrose (2013), Gerienne et al. (2016 and references) and Xue et al. (2016: <i>Drepanophycus</i> rhizomes ca 410 m.y.o.). Lycophytina include the three families below and their fossil relatives, and these latter include zosterophylls,  which have circinately-coiled stems and sporangia in two rows (e.g. Gensel 1992; Kenrick &amp; Crane 1997; Gonez &amp; Gerienne 2010; Gerienne et al. 2016 and references). Zosterophylls and some other genera may form a clade with Lycopodiaceae (Gomez &amp; Gerienne 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Laenen et al. (2014) give some crown-group ages for genera.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Green (2010) described photosynthesis in this clade, focussing on the tree-like extinct lycopsids and the extant Isoetaceae. Tree lycopsids flourished for around 100 m.y. from the end of the Carboniferous to the beginning of the Permian, a time when atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were low and oxygen concentrations were high. Air canals/aerenchyma permeated both above- and below-ground parts of the plants, i.e. they had a parichnos system. This enabled oxygen to move to the roots, where it was used up in respiration, while CO<sub>2</sub> produced by the plant remained in the plant and also moved into the plant from the anoxic CO<sub>2</sub>-rich soil, ultimately going to the leaves, where it was used up in photosynthesis; this is the lycopsid photosynthetic pathway, LPP (Green 2010, esp. p. 2258). However, although movement of oxygen within the plant  may have been facilitated, a pad of tissue at the base of the rootlets cut off their air spaces from those of the stigmarian roots, so overall  CO<sub>2</sub> movement and photosynthesis in the plant are likely to have been little affected (Boyce &amp; DiMichele 2015). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some lycopsids reached perhaps 50 m tall, 2 m d.b.h., and had dichotomously branching stigmarian roots, but they had little secondary or even primary phloem. Cork and a little xylem were all that was produced by the cambium, and the plants seem to have undergone a period of establishment growth (c.f. palms) when the stigmarian root system became established and the apical meristem of the stem enlarged so that when the stem finally began to elongate, it was the "adult" thickness (e.g. Phillips &amp; DiMichele 1992). The phloem, in which the sieve cells may have had degenerate nuclei (c.f. palms: no nuclei at all) is likely to have been very long lived (Boyce &amp; DiMichele 2015). </p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Such  trees are in the same immediate clade as the lowly <i>Isoetes</i> and were dominant in Carboniferous peat swamps. Indeed, rootlets on Carboniferous stigmarian roots have the same branching pattern as in extant <i>Iso&euml;tes</i>; branching is dichotomous, the roots are narrower each dichotomy, but there is otherwise no tapering, and there are root hairs - add similarities in anatomy, and <i>Iso&euml;tes</i> is pracically identical (Hetherington et al. 2016). From the analysis of vascular tissue, it seems that auxin travelled from the base to the apex of the stigmarian root, the "wrong" direction for a stem - which it is morphologically - but the "right" direction for a root - which it is functionally (Sanders et al. 2011). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> There are various associations of fungi with the sporophytes of Lycopodiopsida, although such associations may quite often be absent (Rimington et al. 2014; c.f.  Winther &amp; Friedman 2008).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u>  Leitch and Leitch (2013) found that Lycopodiopsida had rather small nuclear 1C genome sizes - (0.086-)1.7(11.96) pg - but sampling was poor. For the loss of various mitochondrial genes and the distribution of introns - ca 11 <i>cis</i>-splicing introns seem to have been gained - in this clade, see W. Guo et al. (2016b). The <i>ccm</i> genes that have been lost  represent the loss of the mitochondrial cytochrome <i>c</i> maturation pathway.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Lycopodiales may contain fair amounts of silica (Trembath-Reichert et el. 2015). Root-bearing axes of many taxa in this group appear to be modified branches and branch dichotomously, while the rootlets/true roots are modified leaves (Pigg 1992; Rothwell &amp; Erwin 1985; Rothwell 1995) or organs <i>sui generis</i> (Matsunaga &amp; Tomescu 2016; see also Tomescu et al. 2014).  Crane and Kendrick (1997) suggested that all appendicular structures in Lycopodiopsida - microphylls, ligules, sporangia, and stigmarian rootlets - were equivalent, i.e., consistent with the former hypothesis. In <i>Isoetes</i> the roots are exogenous (Rothwell &amp; Erwin 1985) and this is also true of the K-branching that produces root-bearing axes in other Lycopodiopsida, as in a drepanophycalean lycophyte (i.e. in the same immediate clade as <i>Lycopodium</i>) where one branch of a dichotomy becomes a root-bearing axis and which may have a few leaves along its upper part, the other, an erect leafy stem (Matsunaga &amp; Tomescu 2016). Are such roots characteristic of the whole clade? The small, dichotomising roots s. str. (Matsunaga &amp; Tomescu 2016) may have a root cap, and this is reported from other Lycopodiopsida (Friedman et al. 2004, q.v. for caveats over roots in tracheophytes in general). Stubblefield and Rothwell (1981) discuss embryogenesis in Lycopodiopsida. Rothwell and Erwin (1965)  described the roots of <i>Lycopodium</i> and <i>Selaginella</i> as being adventitious. </p>

Although diversification in <i>Lycopodium</i> s.l. may have begun some 200 or more m.y.a. when there are fossils with the distinctive plectostele that characterises <i>Lycopodium</i> s. str., most p&aacute;ramo species are probably derived from epiphytic species within the last 15 m.y.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The divergence of the monilophytes and lignophytes may date to 401-380 m.y.a. (Leebens-Mack et al. 2005); Thei&szlig;en et al. (2001) suggested an age of ca 400 m.y., Clarke et al. (2011: also other estimates) an age of (452-)434(-410) m.y. and Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013) estimated an age of around (422-)411-404(-394) m.y.;  (463.5-)428.9(-400.1) m.y. are the ages in B. Zhong et al. (2014b) and (478.4-)447.4(-415.2) m.y. in Rothfels et al. (2015b). See also Pryer et al. (1995, 2000, 2001a, 2004), P. Soltis et al. (2002: a variety of ages, some very old), Schneider et al. (2002), Stein et al. (2012) and Lars&eacute;n and Rydin (2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For possible apomorphies of crown members of this clade, see Raubeson and Jansen (1992b), Kenrick and Crane (1997), and Schneider et al. (2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Extra-floral nectaries are scattered throughout [Monilophyta + Lignophyta], and Weber and Agrawal (2014) found that their evolution was often - but not always - associated  with an increase in diversification of the clades in which they occurred; they indirectly facilitated diversification. Cyanogenic glycosides, &alpha;-hydroxynitrile glucosides that release hydrogen cyanide when acted upon by plant &beta;-glucosides, are similarly scattered, and Bak et al. (2006) suggest they may be an apomorphy at this level. They note that ferns and gymnosperms have  aromatic cyanogenic glucosides (derived from tyrosine or phenylalanine) and angiosperms have both aliphatic and aromatic glucosides (derived from leucine, isoleucine or valine), the latter group being derived - parallel evolution at different levels perhaps seems as likely.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The leaves of this clade, often called megaphylls, vary considerably. The leaf supply in monilophytes seems to have evolved by dissection of an amphiphloic siphonostele, although the vascular system of the rhizome in some true ferns consists of sympodia (Karafit et al. 2005), while leaf gaps in seed plants are also associated with a stele that consists of a series of sympodia of collateral vascular strands. From this point of view the leaves with large blades in the two groups may represent parallelisms rather than a synapomorphy and leaf gaps are not equivalent; the term "megaphyll" can thus be used in a descriptive sense only (Namboodiri &amp; Beck 1968c; Beck et al. 1982). Furthermore, the growth of fern leaves is accompanied by proliferation at the apex of the blade and that of angiosperms by proliferation at the base (Nardmann &amp; Werr 2013), while Boyce (2005b, 2008a) noted the prevalence of marginal leaf growth in non-angiospermous leaf blades and of diffuse growth in angiosperm leaf blades - these may be oversimplifications, but they suggest differences between the two. Relating such differences to a common pattern of leaf development that includes that of the Lycopodiales/lycophytes is a challenge. For further details of the development/evolution of euphylls, which may well have evolved more than once, see <a href="sporing.html#ExtTrac">above</a>. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u>  Osborne et al. (2004) provide an ecological explanation for the origin of mega/euphylls based on falling CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the latter part of the Devonian.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Support for the stem in monilophytes is provided largely by the lignified stereome, in the outer cortex, while the tracheids are relatively thin walled. In gymnosperms thick-walled tracheids provide much of this support, and in angiosperms, too, it is various elements of the vascular tissue that provide support (e.g. Rowe et al. 2004; Pitterman et al. 2011; Klepsch et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Schuettpelz and Pryer (2009, esp. Tables 2, 3 in the Supplement) and Rothfels et al. (2015b: Appendix S4) provide numerous clade ages in monilophytes, and for more ages of the major monilophyte clades see Y.-L. Qiu et al. (2007) and Schneider et al. (2004a). Schuettpelz and Pryer (2009) also list a number of fossil records (see also Rothwell &amp; Stockey 2008). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Ferns as a whole shows little variation in disparity, that is, the amount/extent of morphological variation in a sample of taxa, over time (Oyston et al. 2016), although in leptosporangiate ferns in particular there has been a gradual increase in disparity over time. There have been several radiations of homosporous leptosporangiate ferns, the first in the Palaeozoic, giving rise to lineages that have since become extinct, and again in the Jurassic and the Cretaceous (Rothwell &amp; Stockey 2008). General fern diversity decreased (along with that of the cycads) through the Cretaceous (Wing &amp; Boucher 1998).  Ferns appear to have temporarily dominated at least locally after the end-Cretaceous bolide impact/Deccan Traps eruptions (Schneider et al. 2004a). The eusporangiate <i>Marattia</i> and <i>Angiopteris</i> and the leptosporangiate royal and tree ferns are almost living fossils and  show little molecular and even morphological evolution (P. Soltis et al. 2002; B. Zhong et al 2014b; Rothfels et al. 2015b; Bomfleur et al. 2014a, c.f. Schneider et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some 98% of living ferns are leptosporangiate ferns, and their main radiation may have have been after the diversification of the angiosperms in the late Cretaceous-early Caenozoic; initially it was a largely terrestrial radiation  (Lovis 1977; Schneider et al. 2004a; Rothwell &amp; Stockey 2008; Schuettpelz &amp; Pryer 2009; H.-M. Liu et al. 2014). Well over 70% of ferns are eupolypods, and about one third of these are epiphytes, amd these make up ca 10% of all vascular epiphytes. Diversification of epiphytic ferns in particular occurred during the Palaeogene, perhaps linked with the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum (Schneider et al. 2004a, b; Schuettpelz 2007; esp. Schuettpelz &amp; Pryer 2009: Supplemental Tables 2, 3; Watkins et al. 2010; c.f. Dubuisson et al. 2009, in part). An exception is <i>Trichomanes</i> and relatives (but not <i>Hymenophyllum</i> and its relatives, for which, see Dubuisson et al. 2009) which diversified in the early Cretaceous; they are commonly epiphytic on tree ferns, which themselves had begun diversifying in the Jurassic (Schuettpelz 2007; also Schuettpelz &amp; Pryer 2009; Rothwell &amp; Stockey 2008 for early radiations of leptosporangiate ferns).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A provisional hierarchy of characters taken from Smith et al. (2006, 2008), Pryer et al. (1996) and Rothfels et al. (2012b) is given below. For a first stab at apomorphies for members of the polypod II clade, see Sundue and Rothfels (2013); their suggestions are largely followed here, and problems with sampling, character state delimitation, and different apomorphies produced by different methods of character optimization are taken into account as far as possible. Only unambiguous synapomorphies (Sundue &amp; Rothfels 2013) are flagged below (see also Pittermann et al. 2015 for petiolar vascular anatomy). Kaplan (1997, vol. 3: chap. 19) summarized the sporangium wall morphology of monilophyta; the annulus is an apomorphy of Polypodiopsida, the leptosporangiate ferns. For other possible apomorphies, see e.g. Schneider et al. (2009). More features need to be added, e.g. if the megaphyllous leaves of most ferns and those of seed plants have evolved independently, which seems likely (see above).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Understanding the evolution of the apparently very unfern-like plant body of Psilotales, particularly that of <i>Psilotum</i> itself, until fairly recently considered to be perhaps the most primitive extant vascular plant. When I was taught about <i>Psilotum</i>, it was compared with the Palaeozoic rhyniophytes, now thought to be entirely unrelated. This still presents difficulties; Kaplan (1997, vol. 3: chap. 10; Siegert 1973 and references) summarize the literature. As he noted, young leaves of <i>Psilotum</i> did have features of fronds (see also Kaplan 1977). Similarly, the leaves of <i>Equisetum</i> may be secondarily simple. Thus its fossil relative <i>Sphenophyllum</i> has much larger leaves with dichotomous venation; bifacial xylem has been found in this genus (Kenrick &amp; Crane 1997; Doyle 2013 and references).</p> 


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> The evolutionary physiology of ferns is repaying examination. Thinking about water transport, the tracheids of ferns tend to be long and wide, and the scalariform perforation plates may extend the length of the cell. As a result, water transport can be relatively efficient (Pittermann et al. 2015); conifers, another group without vessels and that also have quite efficent water transport at least has  secondary thickening and bordered pits (Pittermann et al. 2011). Fern richness in Australia is  correlated with precipitation, and depending on what aspect of diversity is emphasized, precipitation may be linked to equability, etc., bryophytes, but not flowering plants, showing rather similar patterns (Nagalingum et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Epiphytic ferns are concentrated in Hymenophyllaceae, Polypodiaceae, Pteridaceae (e.g. <i>Vittaria</i>) and Dryopteridaceae (e.g. <i>Elaphoglossum</i>) (Schuettpelz &amp; Pryer 2009; Watkins &amp; Cardel&uacute;s 2012; Kato &amp; Tsutsumi 2013; see also above). The gametophytes of these epiphytes are  often strap-shaped and long-lived, and, like other fern gametophytes, are dessication-tolerant; as Watkins et al. (2007a: p. 716) observed, "fern gametophytes are, for all intents and purposes, bryophytes", and the epiphytic species they studied were the most tolerant of drying (see also Nayar &amp; Kaur 1971: survey of gametophyte diversity; Dassler &amp; Farrar 2001; Farrar et al. 2008; Watkins et al. 2007; Rothfels &amp; Schuettpelz 2014; Farrar 2016). Gemmae on these gametophytes (e.g. Pryer et al. 2016; Farrar 1974, 2016) will further increase their longevity. (Moss gametophytes, even their antheridia, are also notably dessication-tolerant - Stark et al. 2016 and references.) Some of these long-lived gametophytes never produce sporophytes, or produce sporophytes only in parts of their ranges (Pinson et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Dessication tolerace is quite common in fern sporophytes, both epiphytic and terrestrial, and peltate scaless may play a central role in the uptake of water, rather as in Bromeliaceae (John &amp; Hasenstein 2016). Ferns show a variety of other adaptations to the ecologically dry epiphytic habitat, including CAM photosynthesis (Keeley &amp; Rundell 2003; Watkins &amp; Cardel&uacute;s 2012), and mycorrhizae are less frequent (e.g. B. Wang &amp; Qiu 2006; Kato &amp; Tsutsumi 2013); nutrients tend to be low in the epiphytic habitat. Testo and Sundue (2014) found that both terrestrial species and hemiepiphytes (where roots from the climbing plant establish  a connection with the soil) were derived within a clade of epiphytic Polypodiaceae, while J. Clark et al. (2016) suggested that the epiphytic habit and increased genome size in eupolypods may be connected. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In seed plants, stomata open in response to both red and blue light. Stomata of those few ferns examined, all leptosporangiates (<i>Pteris</i>, <i>Adiantum</i>, <i>Asplenium</i> and <i>Nephrolepis</i>), lacked a blue light-specific opening response, although elements of the response, including the relevant phototropin, a blue right receptor protein kinase, were present (Doi et al. 2006). In the shaded understory environments that many ferns prefer, blue (and red) light has been preferentially absorbed by the canopy above; stomatal closure is mediated by red light. Doi et al. (2015) later found that there was a blue-light response in other ferns, lycophytes, cycads, etc., indeed, stomata of a few of these taxa, including <i>Equisetum</i>, did not respond to <u>red</u> light. Kawai et al. (2003; see also Suetsugu et al. 2005) noted that there was a distinctive chimaeric red/far red light photoreceptor (phy 3, = neochrome) in which red-sensing phytochrome and blue-sensing phototropin are fused into a single molecule (F.-W. Li et al. 2014) in some Polypodiales, possibly aiding in phototropic responses in the shaded conditions in which ferns have diversified; neochrome is very sensitive to white light (Wada 2008). Neochrome seems to have been acquired by polypod ferns from hornworts via lateral gene transfer around 179 m.y.a., which, perhaps not so coincidentally, is about the age of Polypodiales (Schneider et al. 2004a), and it may even have been acquired more than once (F.-W. Li et al. 2014); it is also known from <i>Mougeoria</i>, Zygnemataceae (Suetsugu et al. 2005). Veins in fern leaves are not the same distance from the epidermis as they are from each other, i.e., they are not hydraulically optimised. However, photosynthesis may proceed best in the low levels of diffuse light and so this hydraulic optimisation may not matter so much (Zwieniecki &amp; Boyce 2014). (Note that in seed plants the effectiveness of the stomatal response is white/blue + red > blue > red > green light [Willmer &amp; Fricker 1996] and in many flowering plants leaves are hydraulically optimised [Zwieniecki &amp; Boyce 2014].) </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Stomatal responses in non-flowering plants have been characterized as being passive, those of flowering plants, active. Thus it has been suggested that fern stomata do not respond to increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the atmosphere (McAdam &amp; Brodribb 2012a), although this has been questioned, such a response apparently being present in the common ancestor of extant vascular plants (Franks &amp; Britton-Harper 2016). Furthermore, the synthesis of abscisic acid, involved in stomatal responses to this and other stimuli, is  not triggered by changes in leaf turgor in non-flowering plants, but it is in flowering plants, although not all of the latter show the same sensitivity to turgor changes (McAdam &amp; Brodribb 2016). Interestingly, the stomata of <i>Equisetum</i> seem to  be permanently closed, and this may also be true for those of <i>Psilotum</i> (Cullen &amp; Rudall 2016). However, details of the physiology of stomatal functioning is unclear and in part conflicting (Lind et al. 2015; Roelfsema &amp; Hedrich 2016 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Around 38-43% of all ferns, epecially members of the [Marattiidae + Polypodiidae] clade, accumulate aluminium (i.e. tissue concentration >1000 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>),  a far higher percentage than in seed plants (Chenery 1949a, b;  Schmitt et al. 2017).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Fertilization &amp; Spore Dispersal.</u> The distributions of the sporophytic and gametophytic plants of the one fern species may be quite different, particularly if the gametophyte is other than heart-shaped. Strap-shaped or filamentous gametophytes can live for a very long time and/or produce gemmae, and so they can persist in sites that are hundreds of miles from the nearest sporophytes (e.g. Farrar 1967; Ebihara et al. 2013). With the advent of the ability to identify gametophytes directly by molecular sequencing, rather than waiting for them to produce sporophytes, this phenomenon is turning out to be remarkably common (Ebihara et al. 2013), and it has interesting implications for the evolution of ferns (see e.g. Ebihara et al. 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Noblin et al. (2012) describe the mechanics of how the annulus functions in sporangium dehiscence.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Overall, herbivory in ferns is about the same as that in angiosperms (Balick et al. 1978; Turcotte et al. 2014: see caveats). However, in the chemically well defended bracken, <i>Pteridium aquilkinum</i>,  at least, herbivory is not associated with jasmonate-mediated regulation of VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions, which in flowering plants, for instance, can attract predatores of herbivores, etc. (Radhika et al. 2012). For herbivory by lithinine geometric moths, which has involved host shifts after a single colonization event, see Weintraub et al. (1995).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> For mycorrhizae in ferns, see Lehnert et al. (2010 and references). Fine endophytes, with their distinctive fan-like arbuscules, are known from ferns; these endophytes are probably mucoromycotes, not <i>Glomus</i> (Orchard et al. 2016 and references). <i>Equisetum</i> is not known to form mycorrhizal associations (Read et al. 2000). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> For the evolution of the monilophyte chloroplast genome, see Karol et al. (2010), Grewe et al. (2013) and J. Clark et al. (2016). Within Polypodiopsida, some inversions in the chloroplast inverted repeat may be high-level synapomorphies (Gao et al. 2009). Grammitidaceae s. str. in particular (included in Polypodiaceae) have green spores and accelerated plastid genome evolution, a correlation found elsewhere in ferns, although it is not 100% (Schneider et al. 2004b), indeed, spores that less obviously contain chloroplasts are quite widespread (Sundue et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Ferns are noted for their high incidence of polyploidy, almost 1/3 (31%) of all speciation events being accompanied by polyploidy (Wood et al. 2009), and base chromosome numbers are also usually very high. There has been recent hybridization between clades (<i>Cystopteris</i>, <i>Gymnocarpium</i>) that diverged an estimated (76.2-)57.9(-40.2) m.y.a. (Rothfels et al. 2015a) while there is hybridization in <i>Osmunda</i> between clades that may have been separated for four times as long (Bomfleur et al. 2014b; Grimm et al. 2015). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For information on genome size, see Obermayer et al. (2002) and J. Clark et al. (2016); particularly large genomes occur in Psilotales and some Ophioglossales, and in a few polypods.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The xyloglucan composition of the primary cell wall varies substantially, that of <i>Equisetum</i> being particularly distinctive (Hsieh &amp; Harris 2012); for cell wall polysaccharides, see also Silva et al. (2011). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Basic sporophyte morphology was outlined by Kaplan (1997, vol. 2: chap. 11, 18, vol. 3: chap. 19, 2001). For the organization of the apical meristem, see Amrbose and Vasco (2015). The stem has a siphonostele, the protoxylem being restricted to lobes of the central xylem strand, hence bringing to mind a necklace (development of the xylem is mesarch, although it is notably variable in the <i>Ophioglossum</i>/<i>Psilotum</i> clade). The protoxylem is described as having G-type tracheids (Edwards 1993). Hern&aacute;ndez-Hern&aacute;ndez et al. (2012) discuss the distribution of the circumendodermal band, tannin-containing cells with thickenings on in inner periclinal and also sometimes the anticlinal walls, that surround the petiolar vascular bundles and that have a common orgin with the endodermis; they also detail the distributions of a number of other vegetative/habit features. Vasco et al. (2013) summarize fern frond morphology and development, noting a number of shoot-like features.  Details of leaf development in <i>Equisetum</i> are similar to those of other ferns and seed plants rather than of lycophytes (Ambrose &amp; Vasco 2016), but it has paracytic stomata unlike those of any other land plants (Cullen &amp; Rudall 2016). For aerophore distribution in ferns, see Davies (1991). The information on horizontal cell walls in early embryo development in ferns given by Philipson (1990) seems to be incorrect - the examples should be vertical?</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the stem apex of ferns, see <a href="sporing.html#ExtTrac">above</a>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Takahashi et al. (2009, 2014 and references) describe gametophyte development in ferns. They note that the apical region converts to a multicellular meristem, which can divide - dichotomous branching - if cell division in the middle of the meristem stops; the branched, strap-shaped gametophytes of epiphytic ferns are simply an extreme variant of this morphology.  Archegonia develop only after the formation of the multicellular meristem. For details of male gamete morphology and movement, etc., see e.g. Renzaglia et al. (2000b, 2002) and Schneider et al. (2002).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For information on pteridophytes in general (these have often - and still may - include lycophytes), see also Kato (2005) and Ranker and Haufler (2008). For other general information, see Raven and Edwards (2001), for comparative anatomy, see Ogura (1972), for vessels, see Sen and Mukhopadhyay (2014 and references), for phloem, see Evert (1990a), for venation, see Wagner (1979) and  Boyce (2005b), for details of stelar morphology and evolution, see Beck et al. (1982), and for young sporophytes, etc., see Johnson and Renzaglia (2009 and references). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> The circumscription of this clade has only recently become clear. It includes the strongly supported [<i>Psilotum</i> + <i>Ophioglossum</i>] clade (<i>Tmesipteris</i> is sister to <i>Psilotum</i>)  perhaps sister to all other ferns, as chloroplast data has broadly tended to suggest (Rothfels et al. 2015b for references). Wickett et al. (2014) obtained a [Marattiales + Psilotales] clade sister to leptosporangiate ferns, but this may be a sampling issue. The inclusion of morphology alone or in combination with molecular data also affects the relationships detected (Wikstr&ouml;m &amp; Pryer 2005 and references); see also Grand et al. (2013) for various morphological analyses.  The position of <i>Equisetum</i> is uncertain. </p>

<p>1. <i>Equisetum</i> may be embedded in ferns, perhaps sister to <i>Angiopteris</i>, etc. (although support  only moderate), the combined clade in turn being sister to remaining ferns (e.g. Pryer et el. 2001a, 2004a; Wikstr&ouml;m &amp; Pryer 2005; Qiu et al. 2007; Ebihara et al. 2011; c.f. in part Wolf et al. 1998). Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016) found that it was sister to the eusporangiate ferns, although support was not strong, indeed, there Marattiales were sister to all other ferns.</p> 

<p>2.  <i>Equisetum</i> may be sister to all other ferns, as in a <i>rps</i>4 analysis, and also 4- and 5-gene analyses, the latter two with strong support (Schuettpelz et al. 2006), analyses of several plastid genes (Rai &amp; Graham 2010), and in a <i>mat</i>K phylogeny (Kuo et al. 2011). Knie et al. (2015) also find good support for the relationships [<i>Equisetum</i> [[<i>Psilotum</i> + <i>Ophioglossum</i>] + The Rest]], as does Rothfels et al. (2015b) in their nuclear gene analysis and Testo and Sundue (2016) in their 4,000 species analysis.  Interestingly, spore wall ultrastructure of <i>Calamites</i>, an extinct equisetaceous plant, is not so different from  that of Ophioglossaceae and other ferns (Lugardon &amp; Brousmiche-Delcambre 1994; Grauvogel-Stamm &amp; Lugardon 2009). <i>Equisetum</i> has no mitochondrial <i>atp</i>1 intron, either a secondary (and parallel) loss or plesiomorphic absence, depending on the topology of the whole group (Wikstr&ouml;m and Pryer 2005: see the character hierarchy below).</p>

<p>3. Schneider et al. (2009) noted potential morphological apomorphies such as simple leaf blade and stems with both radial and dorsiventral symmetries (= erect plus creeping stems...) suggesting a clade  [Psilotales + Equisetales], consistent with some structural changes in the chloroplast genome (Grewe et al. 2013; see also some analyses in Karol et al. 2010; also Wolf &amp; Karol 2012; Ruhfel et al. 2014; J.-M. Lu et al. 2015: chloroplast genomes). </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">This reorganisation of monilophytes has sometimes been severely criticised (Rothwell &amp; Nixon 2006), but it is unclear how damning such criticism is. Since the evaluation of "support" values for particular topologies is integral to the approach adopted in these pages, the decision to exclude such values by those authors makes their work difficult (for me, at least) to interpret. Indeed, in several morphological cladistic analyses (e.g. Bremer 1985; Stevenson &amp; Loconte 1996; Rothwell 1999: fossils included or not) <i>Psilotum</i> came out as sister to all other vascular plants. However, some morphological analyses  (Schneider et al. 2009) do place <i>Psilotum</i> with other monilophytes, even if the same analyses also place flowering plants within a paraphyletic group of extant gymnosperms. You win some, lose some.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Smith et al. (2006, 2008) propose a phylogeny-based reclassification of the ferns, and they also include literature, ordinal and familial synonymy, and a list of accepted genera and some major synonyms; Prelli (2010) gives a nice account of European ferns. However, adjustments to this classification are being made as details of the phylogeny become better understood (Schuettpelz &amp; Pryer 2007, 2008; Kuo et al. 2011; Rothfels et al. 2012b: reclassification of eupolypods II; Rothfels et al. 2015b), and here I follow The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (2016). This should be consulted for details, as the authors make it clear that the monophyly of some genera they accept is unclear - or the genera may even be polyphyletic; further instalments of this classification are eagerly awaited.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A linear sequence of families and genera (Christenhusz et al. 2011a) is now dated, but more recently Christenhusz and Chase (2014) have proposed another classification as has H.-M. Liu (2016). </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> <i>Psilotum</i> and <i>Equisetum</i> had earlier been thought to represent independent lineages, with <i>Psilotum</i> and relatives considered to be the most primitive living vascular plants, and the latter do look superficially similar to some early fossils. Their association with ferns, now very largely accepted, was unexpected (but see Kenrick &amp; Crane 1997). Although Bierhorst (1968, see also 1977) compared <i>Psilotum</i> with the extant fern <i>Stromatopteris</i> and found some morphological similarities, most of these have turned out to be parallelisms and the two are not at all close.</p>

<p>1 <a href="javascript:showImage('../genera/equisetaceaegen.html',600,500)">[list]</a>/15. &plusmn; World-wide, not the Antipodes.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Extant species of <i>Equisetum</i> seem to have separated in the Caenozoic (77.5-)64.8(-52.1) m.y.a. (Des Marais et al. 2003, but c.f. Stanich  et al. 2009). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fossils with many of the apomorphies of crown group <i>Equisetum</i> are known from Upper Jurassic deposits from Patagonia some 150 m.y. or more old (Channing et al. 2011; see also Stanich  et al. 2009); for still older <i>Equisetum</i>-like spores - but with trilete marks - and associated elaters from the Middle Triassic, see Schwendemann et al. (2010). </p> 


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Change in spore morphology from the <i>Calamites</i> type to the at first sight very different trilete spores of <i>Equisetum</i> is convincingly demonstrated by Grauvogel-Stamm and Lugardon (2009). Other fossils placed in this area include <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, which has megaphylls, and this suggests that the tiny leaves of <i>Equisetum</i> may be reduced rather than being microphylls; roots of fossils also differ in morphology and can be polyarch. For the long fossil record of <i>Equisetum</i>, see Channing et al. (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Equistetum</i> tends to grow in ecologically rather stressfull habitats, including hot springs (Channing et al. 2011 and literature; Husby 2012). There is pressurized gas flow, so-called convective ventilation, from the stems into the rhizomes in some extant species of <i>Equisetum</i> and probably in their fossil calamitalean relatives from the Carboniferous. Oxygen moves via interconnected air spaces into the rhizomes, so allowing them to penetrate deeply into the anoxic substrates commonly favoured by this group (Armstrong &amp; Armstrong 2009). However, those species of <i>Equisetum</i> that lack interconnected air spaces - and this is accompanied by changes in position of the flow-resistant endodermis in the stem - have no convective ventilation (Armstrong &amp; Armstrong 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The stomata are likely to be immobile, especially when older, because of the rigid radiating rib-like silica thickenings of the subsidiary cells, and the stomata may even be permanently closed then; the chloroplasts can move from one guard cell to another (Cullen &amp; Rudall 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Reproductive Biology.</u>  Aided by their elaters, spores of <i>Equisetum</i> can either jump up  to 1 cm in the air as they dry, or move by short random walk-type movements along the ground (Marmottant et al. 2013). Studies on the stem of <i>E. hyemale</i> focussing on anatomy, node  number, etc., suggested that how the stem vibrates may affect spore dispersal (Zajaczkowska et al. 2017).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> For a genome duplication in <i>Equisetum</i> dated to (112.5-)92.4(-75.2) - or perhaps only 70-50 - m.y.a., see Vanneste et al. (2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For (1&rarr;3),(1&rarr;4)-&szlig;-d-glucans, see Fry et al. (2008) and Xue and Fry (2012), and for Si concentration, etc., see Husby (2012). Cullen and Rudall (2016) discuss the development of the remarkable stomata in detail; they are mesogenous. The tapetum seems to be involved in the formation of the elaters (Uehara &amp; Murakami 1995).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> <i>Equisetum bogotense</i> is sister to the rest of the genus (Guillon 2007).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b>  Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013: with temporal constraints) estimated an age of around (267.8-)252.7-251.4(-246.1) m.y. for this clade; ca 299 m.y.a.is the age in Schuettpelz and Pryer (2009), (327.8-)301.3(-271.5) m.y. in Rothfels et al. (2015b), (330-)323(-310) m.y. in Y. L. Qiu et al. (2007), perhaps 350 m.y.a. in Schneider et al. (2004a), and (357.5-)357(-356) m.y. in Testo and Sundue (2016) - but only around 170 m.y.a. in Villarreal and Renner (2014). All told, a rather disconcerting spread.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> The large clade made up of leptosporangiate ferns has very strong support (see also Hasebe et al. 1994, 1995, Pryer et al. 1995; Wolf et al. 1998; Quandt et al. 2004; Schuettpelz et al. 2006; Rai &amp; Graham 2010, etc.). Rothfels et al. (2015b) emphasized that their analyses of nuclear data broadly agreed with several plastid sequence analyses. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within the leptosporangiates, <i>Osmunda</i> and relatives, the sporangia of which have some eusporangiate features,  are strongly supported as being sister to the rest. There is further substantial resolution of relationships (e.g. Pryer et al. 2004a, b and references; Schuettpelz &amp; Pryer 2007; c.f. in part Kuo et al. 2011: positions of Gleicheniaceae, Lindsaeaceae, <i>Nephrolepis</i> [previously in Lomariopsidaceae] uncertain). It is unclear whether or not there is a clade [Hymenophyllales + Gleicheniales] (Knie et al. 2015 for literature; Rothfels et al. 2015b: Gleicheniales paraphyletic, but with little support). J.-M. Lu et al. (2015: chloroplast genome, but sampling) found Dipteridaceae and Lygodiaceae to be successive branches along the leptosporangiate stem. Schizaeales and Salviniales (strong support) and Cyatheales (weak support) are successively sister to Polypodiales (e.g. Rothfels et al. 2015), and Rai and Graham (2010) suggest additional variants. For relationships with Schizaeales, see Labiak et al. (2015 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Polypodiales, Lindsaeaceae are probably sister to all others (see also Rothfels et al. 2015b), but the genera <i>Cystodium</i>, ex Dicksoniaceae, and <i>Lonchitis</i> and <i>Saccoloma</i>, both ex Dennstaediaceae - the last as a separate family below - are also in this area (Lehtonen et al. 2012). Pteridaceae and Dennstaediaceae were well supported  as successive sister taxa to the eupolypods (Rothfels et al. 2015b; J.-M. Lu et al. 2015). Davalliaceae and related taxa are sister to the polygrammoid ferns, and both include a number of epiphytes (for their evolution, see Tsutsumi &amp; Kato 2006). Relationships suggested by structural changes in the chloroplast genome (Wolf &amp; Roper 2008; Wolf et al. 2010, 2011) are consistent with those suggested by sequence analyses. <i>Cystopteris</i> and relatives  form a clade that may be sister to the eupolypod II clade (Rothfels et al. 2009, esp. 2012a, 2013, 2015b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The <i>Osmunda</i> clade originated in the late Carboniferous, ca 323 or 305 m.y.a. (Phipps et al. 1998; Schneider et al. 2004a), and is very diverse from the Permian onwards, less so more recently. Fossils some 180 m.y.o. have anatomy  that is remarkably like that of the extant <i>Osmunda claytoniana</i>, and probably the chromosome number and genome size of the fossil plant were similar, too (Bomfleur et al. 2014a). Schneider et al. (2015) reconstruct the history of genome size changes in Osmundaceae; there is some variation. Generation times in royal ferns are long, so genome change might be expected to be low, but whether or not there is "genomic stasis" (Bomfleur et al. 2014a; c.f. Schneider et al. 2015) is another issue; there has been some change.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b>  The age of this clade is estimated at around 199.6 m.y. (Schuettpelz &amp; Pryer 2009); however, estimates from Carvalho et al. (2013) based on fossils that can be assigned to the leptosporangioid branch of the tree suggest an age in excess of ca 265 m.y.a., Late Permian (see also Wilf &amp; Escapa 2014), while the preferred age in Grimm et al. (2015: comprehensive analysis, also incorporating fossils) is (264-)243(-233) m.y. ago.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Todea</i>, hitherto known only from New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand and Soth Africa, has been found in the early Eocene of Patagonia in rocks ca  53 m.y.o. (Carvalho et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">It has been suggested that <i>Osmunda</i> is paraphyletic, with <i>Osmunda</i> (now = <i>Osmundastrum</i>) <i>cinnamomea</i> being sister to the rest of the family (Metzgar et al. 2008); relationships in Carvalho et al. (2013) are [<i>Osmundastrum</i> [<i>Osmunda</i> [<i>Leptopteris</i>, <i>Todea</i>, <i>Todites</i>]]]. However, Bomfleur et al. (2014b) argue for the monophyly of [<i>Osmunda</i> + <i>Osmundastrum</i>] based on extensive data from fossils and a re-evaluation of the molecular evidence, i.a. they note that <i>O. cinnamomea</i> is able to hybridize with some species of <i>Osmunda</i>, but not with other Osmundaceae. Given an estimated date of the split of the first two of (264-)238(-233) m.y.a., only a little less than the age of crown-group Osmundaceae as a whole (Grimm et al. 2015), they have been separated for far longer than any other vascular plants that hybridize.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Around half the family is epiphytic (Zotz 2013), and there are also climbing  taxa (see Dubuisson et al. 2009 for growth forms in <i>Hymenophyllum</i>). Epiphytism in <i>Trichomanes</i> evolved  before that in <i>Hymenophyllum</i>, the plants probably growing on the stems of Cyantheaceae on which species are still often to be found (Hennequin et al. 2008), indeed, diversification in <i>Trichomanes</i> is estimated to have begun in the middle of the Jurassic and that in <i>Hymenophyllum</i> in the middle of the Cretaceous (Schuettpelz &amp; Pryer 2007), ca 147.3 versus ca 41.9 m.y.a. (Schuettpelz &amp; Pryer 2009). See also Schuettpelz and Pryer (2007) and Hennequin et al. (2008) for other dates.</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Despite the  delicate fronds of Hymenophyllaceae, dessication tolerance is at least sometimes well developed - rather like mosses (Proctor 2003, 2012). Indeed, the sporophytes of some epiphytic trichomanoid ferns have lost both cuticle and roots ("regressive evolution" - Dubuisson et al. 2011), and may  be functionally similar to bryophytes; the stem stele may have just a single vascular element (Dubuisson et al. 2013; see also Dubuisson et al. 2003b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The rate of chloroplast genome evolution has slowed down considerably here, probably because of the long generation time of tree ferns (P. Soltis et al. 2002; esp. B. Zhong et al. 2014b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Korall and Pryer (2014) outline major biogeographic patterns in the group; initially Gondwanan vicariance seems to be involved, although crown-goup diversification did not begin until ca 96 m.y.a. with subsequent rather limited (for ferns) transoceanic long distance dispersal. The 100+ endemic species of <i>Cyathea</i> on Madagascar may represent a Pliocene ([4.24-]3.07> m.y) diversification of three separate clades each of which has a fairly lengthy sojourn on the island - thus there was around 30 m.y. in one Malagasy clade before diversification (Janssen et al. 2008, see also Korall &amp; Pryer 2014).

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Elaphoglossum</i> is the major epiphytic genus in the family - ca 400 species (ca 2/3 of the genus) are epiphytes (Zotz 2013). Diversification within the speciose <i>Polystichum</i> began in the Eocene,  (60-)46(-32) m.y.a. (Le P&eacute;chon et al. 2016), that in <i>Elaphoglossum</i> began a bit more recently - and that covers about 2/3 of the family.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a phylogeny of the whole family, see H.-M. Liu et al. (2007, esp. 2015); three subfamilies are recognised, although two genera are unplaced. For a phylogeny of <i>Elaphoglossum</i>, see also L&oacute;riga et al. (2014: 20-15 m.y.a. fossil of ?crown-group <i>Elaphoglossum</i> from Dominican amber). Rouhan et al. et al. (2004) and Vasco et al. (2015) discuss relationships within  <i>Elaphoglossum</i>, where the Coast Rican <i>E. amygdalifolia</i> and the Cuban <i>E. wrightii</i> are successively sister to the rest of the genus. Moran et al. (2010a, b) investigate relationships within the bolbitidoid ferns focussing on variation in perispore morphology. Li and Lu (2006a, b), L.-B. Zhang et al. (2012), Sessa et al. (2012a), and McHenry and Barington (2014: exindusiate Andean species monophyletic, sister to Mexican spp.) have been working on relationships within <i>Dryopteris</i> itself, a genus whose limits are being clarified (e.g. Zhang &amp; Zhang 2012) and which shows extensive hybridization at all levels (Sessa et al. 2012b). Le P&eacute;chon et al. (2016) examined phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships in <i>Polystichum</i>, while Labiak et al.

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Ca 87% of the species of Polypodiaceae are epiphytic (Zotz 2013), making them the major epiphytic clade in the monilophytes, and diversification is associated with the uplift of the Andes (e.g.), clades with broad elevational ranges diversifying faster, speciation being related to climatic/environmental factors, less obviously associated with morphological features (Sundue et al. 2015: epiphytes in general; Kreier et al. 2008: Andean <i>Serpocaulon</i>; L. Wang et al. 2012: Qinghai-Tibet <i>Lepisorus</i>).  Weber and Agrawal (2014) suggested that the evolution of extra-floral nectaries in <i>Pleopeltis</i> was associated with an increase in diversification.</p>
