<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Note:</b>  Possible apomorphies are in bold, (....) denotes a feature common in the clade, exact status uncertain, [....] includes explanatory material. Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).</p>	
	<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Crown Malpighiales probably began radiating some time in the Cretaceous-late Aptian, some 101-114 m.y.a. ([119.4-]113.8[-110.7]/[105.9-]101.6[-101.1] m.y. - high and low estimates: Davis et al. 2005a); initial diversification seems to have been rapid. Other estimates are rather younger. The age of crown group Malpighiales was estimated as (93-)92, 90(-89) m.y. (two penalized likelihood dates), the stem group age being (107-)103(-99) and (95-)91(-87) m.y.; Bayesian relaxed clock estimates were slightly older, to 106 and 112 m.y. respectively (Wang et al. 2009). Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2001) suggested an age for the stem group of only (91-)88(-85) m.y., and for the crown group some (80-)77(-74) m.y. before present, nevertheless, stem groups of many families were evident before the beginning of the Caenozoic. Magall&oacute;n and Castillo (2009: Celastrales sister to Malpighiales) estimated ages of ca 89.3 m.y. for both relaxed and constrained penalized likelihood datings for the divergence of crown Malpighiales, 98.6 and 98.9 m.y. (relaxed and constrained again) for the stem.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The order contains ca 7.8% eudicot diversity (Magall&oacute;n et al. 1999) and show moderately high diversification rates (Magall&oacute;n &amp; Catillo 2009). Xi et al. (2012: see different methods of analysis) examined diversification rates throughout the clade, and found about eight clades in which the rates of diversification decelerated and about five in which they accelerated; these are mentioned individually below.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology.</u> Malpighiales are particularly important in tropical rainforests where they are a major component of the diversity of the understory; they account for up to some 28% of the species and 38% of the total stems there (Davis et al. 2005a), and members of Ericales are another major component of this vegetation. Note that this forest may not have developed until early in the Caenozoic (Burnham &amp; Johnson 2004, see <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#Caenozoic">Caenozoic Diversification</a>), somewhat at odds with the dates just mentioned.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Caterpillars of outgroups to Nymphalidae-Nymphalinae, -Melitaeini, etc., are quite common on Mapighiales (Nylin &amp; Wahlberg 2008). The butterfly <i>Cymotho&euml;</i> has
hosts widely scattered in this order (Ackery 1988), although also found on Bignoniaceae (one species) and Rhamnaceae (sometimes another species). <i>Phyllonorycter</i> leaf-mining moths (Lepidoptera-Gracillariidae - Phyllocnistinae) seem to have diversified on this clade (and especially Fagales) some time in the region of 50.8-27.3 m.y.a., well after the Malpighiales diversified, and after the genus itself evolved, some 76.3-50.3 m.y.a. (Lopez-Vaamonde et al. 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Paracytic stomata may characterise a sizeable clade in Malpighiales, and three-carpellate gynoecia are known friom many families. Articulation of the pedicels is another feature that may be common to the order. The intron in the <i>atp</i>F gene has been lost several times in Malpighiales, alone among angiosperms, however, this varies within Euphorbiaceae, Phyllanthaceae, and Picrodendraceae (Daniell et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">See Endress and Matthews (2006b) for petal appendages, etc., in the order, while Matthews and Endress (2008) discuss other floral variation and Tokuoka and Tobe (2006) integrate testa anatomy and embryology with phylogeny. Tobe and Raven (2011: see also supplement) provide an invaluable summary of embryological data for the whole order although, as they note, many families are poorly known; they plot the distribution of some characters of embryology and seed on a phylogenetic tree, much of which is unresolved. Oginuma and Tobe (2010) provide the first chromosome counts for four families in the order. Furness (2011) looked at pollen development, focusing on the parietal-placentation clade; the massive amount of detail that she found is difficult to optimize on a tree, partly at least because of the still poor sampling.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Although Malpighiales are now strongly supported as being monophyletic (e.g. Davis et al. 2005a; Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009; Xi et al. 2012), relationships within them were initially poorly understood (e.g. Soltis et al. 2007a). Studies on some groups within Malpighiales suggested relationships within particular clades, e.g. Litt and Chase (1999), Schwarzbach and Ricklefs (2000), Chase et al. (2002), and Davis and Chase (2004), and these were in general agreement with relationships apparent in broader studies. Davis et al. (2005a) clarified some relationships in Malpighiales in a four-gene (all three compartments) analysis, in particular suggesting an association between the families with parietal placentation (and also Goupiaceae) and that <i>Centroplacus</i> should be recognised as a separate family (see also Korotkova et al. 2009 and Soltis et al. 2011 for relationships in Malpighiales). The isolated Ctenolophonaceae were linked with Erythroxylaceae and Rhizophoraceae, <i>Bhesa</i> with Centroplacaceae, etc. (Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009).  A [Balanopaceae
[[Trigoniaceae + Dichapetalaceae] [Chrysobalanaceae + Euphroniaceae]]] clade had strong support, e.g. Davis et al. (2005a), Tokuoka and Tobe (2006) and Korotkova et al. (2009).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">However, in 2011 there were still nine clades composed of two or more families along with seven separate families that together formed a very substantial basal polytomy in Malpighiales (Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009; Xi et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). However, relationships apparent in Xi et al. (2012) are much more resolved.  The major analysis in this study used 78 protein-coding plastome genes and four ribosomal genes; families not included were Lophopyxidaceae, Malesherbiaceae and Rafflesiaceae (the last-named for obvious reasons). Other analyses included many more taxa but less complete sampling of genes (see Xi et al. 2012 for details). Malpighiales can now be divided into three main clades, the Salicaceae-Euphorbiaceae, Rhizophoraceae-Clusiaceae, and  Malpighiaceae-Chrysobalanaceae clades, all with substantial molecular support (>80% ML bootstrap, 1.0 p.p.) and even with a modicum of morphological support. Although at the next level of the tree the second two of these clades have polytomies and the first an only weakly-supported dichotomy, overall the improvement of resolution in the tree is substantial (Xi et al. 2012), and the relationships suggested  there are followed here.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Clade 1. [[Humiriaceae [Achariaceae [[Goupiaceae + Violaceae] [Passifloraceae [Lacistemataceae + Salicaceae]]]] [[Peraceae [Rafflesiaceae + Euphorbiaceae]] [[Phyllanthaceae + Picrodendraceae] [Linaceae + Ixonanthaceae]]]].</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although support for the [Humiriaceae [Achariaceae [[Goupiaceae + Violaceae] [Passifloraceae [Lacistemataceae + Salicaceae]]] clade is not strong (Xi et al. 2012), the clade excluding Humiriaceae (= the parietal clade) has very strong support. Goupiaceae are certainly to be included here, although their association with Violaceae is only weakly supported, as is the position of the combined clade (Xi et al. 2012). Major relationships in the rest of this clade have strong support (Xi et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Molecular evidence that the whole group  of families with parietal placentation and (often) three carpels is monophyletic had initially not been compelling (e.g.
see Savolainen et al. 2000a; Chase et al. 2002), although part of the <i>rpS</i> 16 gene is absent from Passifloraceae-Passifloroideae and -Turneroideae,  Violaceae, and Salicaceae s. str. (and also Linaceae and Malpighiaceae, so really a feature of Malpighiales?: see Downie &amp; Palmer 1992). Salicaceae were weakly associated with Passifloraceae, and in turn with Humiriaceae and Pandaceae, and Violaceae were weakly associated with Achariaceae (and Goupiaceae, Lacistemataceae and Ctenolophonaceae) in Chase et al (2002). Tokuoka and Tobe (2006) found a weakly-supported relationship between the Passifloraceae group and Violaceae (see also Soltis et al. 2007a), and strongly supported relationships between Lacistemataceae and Salicaceae. However, Davis et al. (2005a) found a moderately supported association of these taxa with parietal placentation (59% bootstrap, 1.00 posterior probability), and also Goupiaceae, with axile placentation, and a similar grouping is also evident in e.g. Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2001), Wurdack and Davis (2009), Korotkova et al. (2009: 83% jacknife, 1.00 pp, Goupiaceae not included) and Soltis et al. (2011: details of relationships unclear). <i>Ixonanthes</i> was rather surprisingly embedded in Achariaceae in the Bayesian analysis of Soltis et al. (2007a), but that was  due to misidentification of the material, which was a species of <i>Hydnocarpus</i> (K. Wurdack, pers. comm.). </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Indeed, classical morphological studies had been suggesting a grouping that included Salicaceae, Achariaceae and Violaceae, and
sometimes also Passifloraceae and its segregates, Malesherbiaceae and Turneraceae, in part because of their common possession of parietal placentation, some sort of corona or scales in the flower, nectaries outside the stamens, etc. (e.g. Nandi et al. 1998). Furthermore, it was known that species of the old Flacourtiaceae had one of two kinds of
seed coat: the exotegmen was either more or less fibrous - taxa with this kind of exotegmen are now mostly in Salicaceae - or massive and non-fibrous - taxa with this exotegmen are now in Achariaceae (Corner 1976).  It was also commonly recognized that Salicaceae were simply an extreme morphology reflecting the wind pollination common in that family, and that they  could be linked with some of the old Flacourtiaceae. Distinctive cyclopentenoid cyanogenic
glucosides and/or cyclopentenyl fatty acids, including gynocardin, also occur sporadically here (Webber &amp; Miller 2008). The inclusion of Goupiaceae in this clade is the only real surprise since it is morphologically rather distinct. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The other weakly supported clade in Clade 1 is [[Peraceae [Rafflesiaceae + Euphorbiaceae]] [[Phyllanthaceae + Picrodendraceae] [Linaceae + Ixonanthaceae]]]], the euphorbioids. This is an unexpected clade in that the fruits of a rather broadly delimited Euphorbiaceae (inc. both Phyllanthaceae and
Putranjivaceae) are very distinctive, with the walls falling away leaving the persistent columella, and that was one of the main characters that I used to recognize herbarium material of the family. It is hardly surprising that Merino Sutter and Endress (1995) argued for a broad circumscription of the family. However, the clade [[Phyllanthaceae + Picrodendraceae] [Linaceae + Ixonanthaceae]] is strongly supported, as is the [Peraceae [Rafflesiaceae + Euphorbiaceae]] clade (Xi et al. 2012). The inclusion of Rafflesiaceae in Malpighiales follows the recent findings of Barkman et al. (2004, 2007), Davis and Wurdack (2004), and in particular Davis et al. (2006), who place it with strong support as sister to Euphorbiaceae s. str.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Clade 2. [[Ctenolophonaceae [Erythroxylaceae +
Rhizophoraceae]], [Irvingiaceae + Pandaceae], [Ochnaceae [[Clusiaceae + Bonnetiaceae] [Calophyllaceae [Hypericaceae +
Podostemaceae]]]]].</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Weak support for an association of [Caryocaraceae [Linaceae + Irvingiaceae]] with [Rhizophoraceae + Erythroxylaceae] (Soltis et al. 2007a), has not been strengthened, although they have a number of features in common, such as a basally connate androecium, epitropous ovules with an endothelium, etc. (Matthews &amp; Endress 2007). Although Ctenolophonaceae, etc., might also be associated, their floral similarities did not seem to be so great. However, Wurdack and Davis (2009) found support for the clade [Ctenolophonaceae [Erythroxylaceae +
Rhizophoraceae]], but further relationships were unclear. In the recent study by Xi et al. (2012), the clade [Ctenolophonaceae [Erythroxylaceae +
Rhizophoraceae]] (= rhizophoroids) had strong support, [Pandaceae + Irvingiaceae] (pandoids) had weak support.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The clade [Ochnaceae [[Clusiaceae + Bonnetiaceae] [Calophyllaceae [Hypericaceae +
Podostemaceae]]]]] has only weak support (70% ML bootstrap, 0.81 p.p.: Xi et al. 2012), but its composition is consistent with morphology; Ochnaceae and Clusiaceae et al. (the latter = clusioids) also have a generally similar flavonoid spectrum (Hegnauer 1990). For relationships in the core Bonnetiaceae-Podostemaceae clade (= clusioids: Xi et al. 2012), Calophyllaceae being recognized, see Wurdack and Davis (2009; esp.  Ruhfel et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Clade 3. [[Lophopyxidaceae + Putranjivaceae], Caryocaraceae, [Centroplacaceae [Elatinaceae + Malpighiaceae]], [Balanopaceae
[[Trigoniaceae + Dichapetalaceae] [Chrysobalanaceae + Euphroniaceae]]]].</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although this clade has strong support in Xi et al. (2012), relationships within it are poorly understood. The [Balanopaceae
[[Trigoniaceae + Dichapetalaceae] [Chrysobalanaceae + Euphroniaceae]]] and [Putranjivaceae + Lophopyxidaceae] clades (= chrysobalanoids and putranjivoids respectively) are well supported, but the [Centroplacaceae [Elatinaceae + Malpighiaceae]] clade (malpighioids) has poor support. The particular position of the distinctive Caryocaraceae is unclear, althougth there is little question that it belongs here (Xi et al. 2012). There was some support for Picrodendraceae as sister to the chrysobalanoids in Soltis et al. (2007a: as Pseudanthaceae, Phyllanthaceae not included), but this relationship has not been confirmed.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> A.P.G. thought that it would be useful to adopt a narrow circumscription for families that used to be included in Flacourtiaceae and Euphorbiaceae s.l. Even if future work were to suggest reaggregation of genera that had been placed in those two families, the composition of the clades recognized would be different from those in nominally the same families by previous classifications. Indeed, the realignments caused by the break-up of the old Flacourtiaceae and integration with Salicaceae and Achariaceae correlate well with a number of morphological and anatomical characters (Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009). Furthermore, these earlier decisions are compatible with the tree in Xi et al. (2012), for instance, to restore Euphorbiaceae to close to its old broad circumscription would require the inclusion of Linaceae, Ixonanthaceae and Rafflesiaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> The problems faced when working out the circumscription and relationships of the small family Ixonanthaceae, here sister to Linaceae (Clade 1, with strong support), are a microcosm of similar problems taxonomists had faced - yes, there are distinctive characters, but which reliably indicate relationships?  Thus Robson and Airy Shaw (1962) drew attention
to the "spiral convolution of the filaments and style" of <i>Cyrillopsis</i> (Ixonanthaceae: Clade 1)
which, they thought, were points of similarity between this genus and Irvingiaceae
(Clade 2). However, in Ixonanthaceae <i>Allantospermum</i>
and some species of <i>Ochthocosmus</i> have flowers very similar to those
of <i>Cyrillopsis</i>, with the thin calyx reflexed after anthesis (<i>Phyllocosmus</i>,
<i>Ixonanthes</i>), while other species of <i>Ochthocosmus</i> have persistent,
erect, almost scarious-looking sepals, as is common in Linaceae. Takhtajan (1997) included <i>Allantospermum</i>
in Irvingiaceae; both have flowers with two carpels and seeds with copious endosperm, and the
inflorescences of some Ixonanthaceae are very like those of Irvingiaceae. Bove (1997), on the other hand, suggested that Ixonanthaceae and Humiriaceae (Clade 1, but not immediately related) were sister taxa, both having ellagic acid, a "free" disc encircling the ovary, and an entire stigma. In the context of Linales (also including Linaceae, Hugoniaceae, Erythroxylaceae [also Clade 2, not immediately related to Erythroxylaceae]: see Cronquist 1981), Ixonanthaceae, Bove thought, were rather different in their free stamens, semi-inferior ovaries and pollen grains with supratectal spines. Recent work (2016) suggests  that <i>Allantospermum</i> is properly to be included in Irvingiaceae, and overall, characters are consistent with this position.</p>

<ul><li>Ctenolophonaceae are trees that may be recognised by their opposite,
entire leaves with interpetiolar stipules and their terminal inflorescences
with rather elongated flower buds. The
rounded sepals are persistent and accrescent, and the grey-drying and
closely-ribbed fruit is distinctive. There is a single seed that is half enveloped by the hairy aril; it remains attached to the slender central columella.</ul>

([109.6-]101.8[-96.6]/[97.1-]91.0[-88.1] m.y.: Davis et al. 2005a). The distinctive pollen is known as fossils from South America and India, the earliest records being from Africa in the Upper Cretaceous (Muller 1981; Krutzsch 1989). However, the diversification rate in this clade may have decreased (Xi et al. 2012).</p>

"marginal" stomata on the disc and the anthers have a broad

of <i>Erythroxylum coca</i> were described as being revolute by Cullen (1978);
they are involute (e.g. Peyritsch 1878; Weberling et al. 1980; Rury 1982; Keller 1996). Matthews and Endress (2011) described the complexity of the postgenital fusion of the petals.</p>

<p>Synonymy: <b>Mangiaceae</b>
Rafinesque</p>

<ul><li>Rhizophoraceae are shrubs to trees that may be recognised by their opposite
often serrate leaves and large interpetiolar stipules. The flowers are quite often other than
5-merous, the calyx is thick and valvate, the petals are often lobed or fringed,
each enclosing one or small groups of stamens, and the ovary is often more or less inferior. Gynotrocheae and Rhizophoreae have aerial
prop roots.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  See below.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Mangrove taxa in Rhizophoraceae are derived within the family (e.g. Schwarzbach &amp; Ricklefs 2000) and are most diverse in the
Southeast Asia-Malesian area. Their seeds
have little endosperm and are viviparous (aquatic/marine/mangrove plants in general quite commonly have large embryos, e.g. Feller et al. 2010), and in all genera except <i>Bruguiera</i> the endosperm overflows from the seed, pushing open the micropyle as it does so. After the seed falls from the tree it may float in the water, the hypocotyl straightening and establishment of the seeding being by the development of lateral roots (Juncosa &amp; Tomlinson 1988b). Depending on the genus, there are either stilt roots, plank roots, or pneumatophores. Axillary buds soon die so the plants cannot regenerate when cut, or if the twigs are killed by frost, etc. (see Tomlinson 1986 for much useful information). Robert et al. (2009) discuss the hydraulic architecture of the wood of <i>Rhizophora</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Rhizophoraceae-Rhizophoreae are a major component in the mangrove ecosystem, but overall only few species of flowering plants grow there, and apart from Rhizophoreae they are largely unrelated. A mere 34 species in nine genera and five families dominate the vegetation (half are Rhizophoraceae), while there are another 20 species in 11 genera and ten families (only one also including dominant species) that are quite common (Tomlinson 1986, estimates in Spalding et al. 2010 are 38 core species, 73 species of true mangroves). Mangroves can be divided into two groups, the much more speciose eastern group, from east Africa to the western Pacific, which includes ca 40 species, ca 14 of which are Rhizophoraceae, and the western group, from west Africa to the Americas, with only eight species, three of which are Rhizophoraceae; depending on how species limits are drawn, no common mangrove species is common to the two areas (Tomlinson 1986). Families include Primulaceae-Myrsinoideae (<i>Aegiceras</i>), Lythraceae (<i>Sonneratia</i>), Acanthaceae (<i>Acanthus ilicifolius</i>, <i>Avicennia</i>), Tetrameristaceae (<i>Pelliceria</i>) and Combretaceae (<i>Lumnitzera</i>). Of the dominant species, <i>Nypa fruticans</i> in particular forms monospecific stands growing along rivers to the upper limits of tidal influence. For the evolution of the mangrove ecosystem, which also involves diversification of clades of molluscs, etc. (Reid et al. 2008), see Ellison et al. (1999) and especially Plaziat et al. (2001 and references). A division of mangroves into two largely exclusive areas, the more diverse Indo-West Pacific and the less diverse Caribbean-West Atlantic areas, seems to have occurred by ca 20 m.y.a. (Plaziat et al. 2001).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fossil and current distributions of these mangrove plants seem to have little to do with each other, and the history of individual mangrove species is complicated. By the Eocene, ca 50 m.y.a., many mangrove genera are known from the fossil record, and several, including <i>Pelliciera</i>, are known from both the Old and the New World (but see Mart&iacute;nez-Mill&aacute;n 2010).  <i>Pelliciera</i> is now Central American, although growing in Europe in the past (Plaziat et al. 2001). <i>Nypa</i> <a href="arecalesweb.htm#Arecaceae" target="home">(Arecaceae</a>, q.v. for fossils), today found only in the Indo-Malesian area, appeared in the Upper Cretaceous ca 70 m.y.a. and by the early Palaeocene ca 55 m.y.a. was found in both the Old and New Worlds. Even though <i>Rhizophora</i> is known from the Caribbean in the late Eocene, the common ancestor of the existing populations there may have arrived in the New World some 40 m.y. later, only ca 11 m.y.a. (Graham 2006); there may be considerable genetic differentiation within Atlantic populations of mangrove species (Takayama et al. 2008a, b). Fossil hypocotyls identified as <i>Ceriops</i> and preserved with good anatomical detail are known from the Lower Eocene London Clay (Wilkinson 1981), although Collinson and van Bergen (2004) noted that the fossils did not show distinctive curvature of modern mangroves (Rhizophoreae) seedlings. At the other geographic extreme, Rhizophoreae are known from the Early Eocene 55-48.5 m.y.a. in western Tasmania, Australia (Pole 2007).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The mangrove ecosystem is very productive and has high carbon flux rates, and it also stores much carbon, especially below ground - at about 1,000 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup>, storage is about three times as much as in temperate, boreal or tropical upland forests. Mangroves occupy 13.7-15.2  million hectares, and they may store 4-20 PgC globally (Bouillon et al. 2008; Donato et al. 2011 and references). Other estimates are that they bury 17.0-23.6 TgCy<sup>-1</sup>, their gross primary productivity is 2087 gCm<sup>2</sup>y<sup>-1</sup>, global  primary productivity is 417 TgCy<sup>-1</sup>, but with a rather lower net ecosystem production (221 gCm<sup>2</sup>y<sup>-1></sup> and globally 44 TgCy<sup>-1</sup>) because of a relatively high respiration rate, at least as compared with sea grasses (Duarte et al. 2005: area estimated at 20 million hectares). Mangrove peat can become very thick, the carbon in it being thousands of years old (McKee et al. 2007). See also Feller et al. (2010) for mangrove physiology, carbon flux, etc., and also <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#Cladeasymmetries" target="home">Clade Asymmetries</a>.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> Pollen in Rhizophoreae is deposited on to the hairy petals, so there may be secondary pollen presentation, but pollination is basically explosive, the stamens being held in groups by the petals until the flower is tripped by the pollinator. These petals often have an arista or other appendages, and are shaped like a tiny bivalve mollusc (Endress &amp; Matthews 2006b). The pollen grains are very small, and in <i>Rhizophora</i> in particular pollination may be by wind (Juncosa &amp; Tomlinson 1988b).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Growth in a number of Rhizophoraceae may be continuous, although growth patterns in Macarisieae are unknown. Cork initation in the root is superficial in at least some taxa, perhaps just those with stilt roots (see von Guttenberg 1968 for <i>Carallia</i>). The leaf teeth are theoid.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is considerable variation in merosity in the family, <i>Carallia</i> having K5 C5 A5 G5, and both carpel and stamen number vary (Matthews &amp; Endress 2011). The stamens in polystemonous flowers arise from ring primordia (Ronse de Craene &amp; Smets 1992b). <i>Rhizophora</i> has transversely arranged carpels
(Eichler 1876). Variation in testal morphology in Gynotrocheae in particular is considerable, <i>Gynotroches</i> and <i>Pellacalyx</i>, with strongly exotegmic seeds, differing so much from <i>Carallia</i>, which lacks an exotegmen, that Corner (1976) preferred to segregate the former as Legnotidaceae - a comprehensive survey of seed anatomy in the family is desirable.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">See also Juncosa and Tomlinson (1988) and Schwarzbackh (2013), general, Howard (1970) and Baranova and Jeffrey (2006), anatomy, Tobe and Raven (1987e, 1988b: seed coat anatomy), Endress and Matthews (2006b: petal morphology) and Carey (1934: embryology); for information on <i>Paradrypetes</i>, see Levin (1986, 1992) and Radcliffe Smith (2001 - as Euphorbiaceae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Schwarzbach and Ricklefs (2000) found strong phylogenetic structure in the family, with three major clades. At least some Macarisieae have stamens of two lengths  and well-developed anther connectives (D. Kenfack, pers. comm.), probably plesiomorphic features. <i>Crossostylis</i>, with dehiscent fruits and arillate seeds, is embedded in Gynotrocheae, which otherwise have fleshy, indehiscent fruits and seeds without arils. Fleshy indehiscent fruits may have evolved in parallel within Gynotrocheae, or  the arillate seed, etc., of <i>Gynotroches</i> is a reversal. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Rather surprisingly, molecular data also place <i>Paradrypetes</i>
(ex Euphorbiaceae) here (e.g. Davis et al. 2005a), strongly supported as sister to <i>Cassipourea</i> (Wurdack &amp; Davies 2008: only one species from each tribe included). <i>Paradrypetes</i> has a rather unexpected combination of characters and is highly apomorphic (see above). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Schwarzbach and Ricklefs (2000) suggested that three tribes be recognized for the three major clades that were apparent in their phylogeny of the family.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Rhizophoraceae have often been associated with Myrtales (e.g. Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1997), and they have sometimes included or been closely associated with (Takhtajan 1997) Anisophylleaceae, here in Cucurbitales.</p>

<ul><li>In Irvingiaceae, the leaves, often with longitudinal markings,
very long (to 22 cm!), deciduous, intrapetiolar stipules, and rather closely parallel secondary venation, are
distinctive. The axillary buds are also
prominent, and prophylls are basal on the shoots. The pedicels are articulated at the junction with the axis; the flowers are small, more or less rotate and the stamens long, and the nectariferous disc is very obvious. The drupes often have radial fibres.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Stem-group Irvingiaceae may have diverged in the Cretaceous-Albian some 111-100 m.y.a. (Davis et al. 2005a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Keller (1996) suggests that the leaves are involute in bud; this should be confirmed. Netolitzky (1926) is unclear about exactly where the fibrous layer is in the seeds of <i>Desbordea</i> and <i>Klainedoxa</i>, suggesting that the latter is exotestal, although Boesewinkel (1994) calls it exotegmic, which seems more likely.</p>

is sister to <i>Erythroxylum</i> in a tree presented by Fernando et al. (1995), and
the stipules of Irvingiaceae, Erthroxylaceae and Ixonanthaceae
are similar (Weberling et al. 1980); Irvingiaceae are weakly associated with Putranjivaceae in Chase et al (2002a) and with Linaceae in Davis et al. (2005a). Prior to xii.2015, <i>Allantospermum</i> was in Ixonanthaceae...</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Pandaceae seem to be a very old and isolated clade, dating back perhaps to the late Aptian (Cretaceous) 114-112 m.y.a. ([118.7-]113.8[-110.2]/[105.5-]101.6[-101.9] m.y.: Davis et al. 2005a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Panda</i> smells like onions. <i>Microdesmis</i> has punctate leaves. The plagiotropic branches have been confused with compound
leaves, especially in the derived <i>Galearia</i> and <i>Panda</i>; the stipules may be asymmetrically placed, as in <i>Panda</i>. If the pedicels are articulated, they are articulated only at the very base.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For information - although there is little knowledge of embryology, etc. -  mostly as Euphorbiaceae, see Forman (1966), Radcliffe-Smith (2001: genera), van Welzen (2011) and Kubitzki (2013b), all general, Vaughan
and Rest (1969), Hegnauer (1969: chemistry), Stuppy (1996: seed anatomy), Nowicke et al. (1998: pollen), and Tokuoka and Tobe (2003: ovules and seeds).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> What is known about wood anatomy suggests that <i>Galearia</i> and <i>Panda</i> are close, while pollen suggests that <i>Galearia</i> and <i>Microdesmis</i> are close... (van Welzen 2011). The relationships [<i>Microdesmis</i> [<i>Galearia</i> + <i>Panda</i>]] are strongly supported by molcecular data (see Xi et al. 2012).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For a checklist and bibliography, see Govaerts et al. (2000, vol. 4).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Pandaceae are still often included in Euphorbiaceae, e.g. Govaerts et al. (2000) and Radcliffe-Smith (2001), but they differ from even the uniovulate taxa (Peraceae and Euphorbiaceae s. str.) in several respects, including their indehiscent fruits. Rays of Euphorbiaceae are only 1-5 cells wide (Hayden &amp; Hayden 2000); Pandaceae lack obturators, while Euphorbiaceae have them - another difference. <i>Dicoelia</i>
(Euphorbiaceae - Dicoelieae) and <i>Galearia</i> both have stamens in
depressions in the petals. However, <i>Dicoelia</i>
has a low, thin-walled testa, a massive exotegmen, and a moderately thickened
mesotegmen (Stuppy 1996), and it is to be placed in Phyllanthaceae (Kathriarachchi et al. 2005). <i>Centroplacus</i> is also not included, although it is placed sister to Pandaceae, but without much support, by Wurdack et al. (2004); see Centroplacaceae here.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Engler had trouble with <i>Panda</i>, mistaking its plagiotropic branches for compound leaves, so he described it first as a species of Burseraceae, then as a species in Sapindaceae, and after he recognized his mistake, he was still unclear as to its relationships and placed it in a monotypic Pandales (Forman 1966).</p>

<p>Synonymy: <b>Quiinaceae</b> Engler, <i>nom. cons.</i></p>

<ul><li>Ochnaceae are evergreen trees whose leaves are usually serrate, stipulate and have dense and prominent venation.</ul>

<ul><li>Ochnoideae are recognisable by their alternate, often
coriaceous leaves with rather sharply serrate margins, more or less brochidodromous venation
- the secondary veins can be very closely parallel - and rather scaly stipules that have strong,
parallel veins and also may have fringed margins. The rather scarious calyx is also distinctive, the anthers often open by
pores, and the style is sometimes gynobasic. </ul>

<ul><li><i>Medusagyne</i> has a
distinctive fibrous bark rather like that of <i>Juniperus</i>. Its leaves are opposite, toothed, and with
very strongly reticulate venation. The
flowers, with their contorted petals, numerous stamens and carpels with
marginal styles are distinctive, as are the fruit, the valves of which pull
away from the central columella, except at their apices, so looking rather like a parasol of sorts. </ul>

<ul><li>Quiinoideae may be readily
recognised, even when sterile, by their opposite or whorled, sometimes compound or deeply lobed (especially in seedlings), strongly
stipulate leaves; the secondary veins are well-developed, the fine venation is like the strokes of a paint brush, and the stipules are more or less persistent. There are well-developed mucilaginous canals. Both stipules and sepals are pubescent and the often baccate fruits are striate when dry.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> This clade (= ochnoids: Xi et al. 2012) may have diverged in the Cretaceous-Albian  (117-)111(-106()/(104-)99.6(-98.8) m.y.a.: Davis et al. 2005a). The restriction of <i>Medusagyne</i> to the Seychelles is noteworthy since the ocean crust separating India and the Seychelles started forming ca 63.4 m.y. old (Collier et al. 2008); the diversification rate in this clade may have slowed down (Xi et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Sauvagesia</i> lacks vestured pits; two other genera in Ochnoideae are recorded as having them (Jansen et al. 2001).  <i>Godoya</i> has stratified phloem. There are mucilage cells or mucilage
channels, and the plants sometimes have watery juice.</p>
 
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For floral morphology in the whole group, see Matthews et al. (2011, esp. 2012, very useful). There is considerable variation in floral morphology in Ochnaceae-Ochnoideae. <i>Sauvagesia</i> has numerous linear staminodes, five petal-like staminodes opposite the petals, and five stamens opposite the sepals. The antesepalous primordia of <i>Ochna</i> (Ochnoideae-Ochneae) show
centripetal androecial development (Pauz&eacute; &amp; Sattler 1978), while the androecia of members of the other two tribes have centrifugal development (Amaral &amp; Bittrich 1998). Zygomorphy is largely the result of the
unequal later development of the androecium, but in <i>Philacra</i> and <i>Luxembergia</i>
it is evident early in development (Amaral &amp; Bittrich 1998). Although the anthers are often porose, there is still an endothecium (quite often absent in such situations), and this perhaps facilitates reversal from the porose condition (Amaral &amp; Bittrich 2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is also considerable variation in the ovule, etc., of <i>Ochna</i>, alternatively, some reports must be incorrect. Chikkannaiah and Mahalingappa (1974) suggest that there is no endothelium, but the nucellar epidermis seems to take over that function. <i>Lophira</i> has
unequally accrescent sepals, two members forming wings (there are only two carpels, each with many ovules, and the testa is thin).  Batygina et al. (1991, p. 222)
show <i>Sauvagesia erecta</i> as having a much enlarged endotesta with thick
walls.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For further information on Ochnoideae, see van Tieghem (1902: general, esp. embryo), Amaral
(1991), and Amaral and Bittrich (2013), all general, Hegnauer (1966, 1989: chemistry), Dickison (1981: anatomy), and Narayana (1975) and Gu&egrave;d&egrave;s and Sastre  (1981), both embryology.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In <i>Medusagyne</i> the upper ovules are ascending and
epitropous, the lower ovules descending and apotropous (Batygina et al. 1991;
Doweld 1998b). Additional information on <i>Medusagyne</i> is taken
from Robinson et al. (1989) and Dickison and Kubitzki (2013), general, Dickison (1990a, 1990b: morphology and anatomy), and Fay et al. (1997a: relationships and morphology). For comparison of the fruit dehiscence of <i>Medusagyne</i> with that of some Ochnaceae, particularly some Sauvagesioideae, see Fay et al. (1997a); the anatomy of the fruits is similar to
that of Caryocaraceae (Dickison 1990a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The venation of the leaves of Quiinoideae is very distinctive, although not that dissimilar from that of other Ochnaceae, and it has been studied in detail by Foster (1952 and references). Veinlets ending free in the mesophyll can be few or even absent. The stomata are described as being paracytic by Schneider et al. (2002). For general information, see Kubitzki (2013b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Medusagyne</i> and Quiinoideae are largely unknown embryologically, etc.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> There is good molecular support for a monophyletic Ochnaceae s.l., e.g. Fay et al. (1997a),
Nandi et al. (1998), Savolainen et al. (2000a), Chase et al. (2002) and Korotkova et al. (2009). Relationships between the three clades that make Ochnaceae up were less clear.  However, Xi et al. (2012: as families) found moderate (75% ML bootstrap; 1.00 p.p.) support for a [Medusagynoideae + Quiinoideae] clade. Within Quiinoideae, <i>Froesia</i> is sister to the rest of Quiinoideae (Schneider et al. 2006, see also 2002 for a morphological phylogeny); it has separate
carpels, follicles (apomorphies), and glabrous seeds (a plesiomorphy). Relationships among the other three genera are unclear.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Including Ochnaceae, Medusagynaceae and Quiinaceae in Ochnaceae s.l. was an optional arrangement in A.P.G. II, and they have much in common; Ochnaceae s.l. are recognized in A.P.G. III (2009).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous relationships.</b> Diegodendraceae, included in Ochnaceae by Cronquist (1981), are placed in
Malvales (see also Amaral 1991). <i>Medusagyne</i> is morphologically very distinctive. Comments on the species cover of <i>Medusagyne</i> at the
Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, ca 1985: &quot;c.f. <i>Actinidia</i>. - Would be much better placed in
Guttiferae or Hypericaceae - !!!!! - this plant allied to Myrtales. - Nonsense!
- oh yes it is!&quot;. Hardly surprisingly, it was
placed in a monotypic Medusagynales (Theanae) by Takhtajan (1997) and generally
associated with Theales (e.g. Cronquist 1981); the latter was already such an heterogeneous group that the further inclusion of practically anything made little difference to its description... Van Tieghem (1902) thought that on balance Clusiaceae s.l. and Ochnaceae might be close, largely because of the polystemony of the former and also some of the latter.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The stem of this clade seems to have diverged in the Cretaceous-Albian, 111-100 m.y.a., Clusiaceae (there sister to the rest of the clade) in turn diverging perhaps in the Cenomanian (104-)94(-92)/(95-)89(-87) m.y.a. (Davis et al. 2005a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are several potential morphological synapomorphies for the clade (= clusioids: Xi et al. 2012), and it is recovered even in morphological phylogenetic analyses (e.g. Luna &amp; Ochoterena 2004 - Hypericaceae not included). Xanthones are uncommon elsewhere, being known from Gentianeae, some Moraceae, etc. The xanthones of Podostemaceae are similar
to those both of Gentianaceae (in their -6-0-glucosides) and of Clusiaceae (in their isoprenyl
substitutions). The morphology of Podostemaceae is so highly derived that finding synapomorphies with Hypericaceae is difficult.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b>  For a summary of the chemistry of the group, see Crockett and Robson (2011); exactly where on the tree particular classes of secondary metabolites are to be placed will depend  on more detailed sampling.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Given the likely phylogenetic relationships above, anatomical studies of Bonnetiaceae are needed to clarify the apparent absence - or near absence - of secretory tissues there. Takhtajan (1993) describes the pith as having secretory canals, as in Clusiaceae, but c.f. Baretta-Kuipers (1976). It is quite common for the calyx to be small relative to the corolla in bud, so the corolla has taken over the protective function, although in taxa like <i>Calophyllum</i> and <i>Clusia</i> the bud is at first completely enclosed by the sepals. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Relationships within this clade were initially
unclear (see also Soltis et al. 1999b; Gustaffson et al. 2002; Davis et al. 2005b), although Wurdack and Davis (2009) and particularly Ruhfel et al. (2011, see also Xi et al. 2012) have recently confirmed the paraphyly of the old Clusiaceae, necessitating the separation of Calophyllaceae (= Clusiaceae-Kielmeyeroideae of versions 8 and before). Support for all relationships is strong, although that for the [Bonnetiaceae + Clusiaceae] clade is the weakest (Xi et al. 2012). The branch leading to Podostemaceae is rather long. The xanthones of Podostemaceae are similar to those both of Gentianaceae (in the -6-0-glucosides) and of Clusiaceae (in the isoprenyl substitutions).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Morphological data in particular (most of the features above) initially seemed to suggest a grouping of Elatinaceae + Bonneticaceae + Clusiaceae/Hypericaceae (e.g. see versions of this site prior to version 5). This was not a monophyletic group in
Savolainen et al. (2000a), indeed, <i>Ploiarium</i> is there placed in Malvales (but see Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009), although testa anatomy, etc., are strongly against such a position. Analyses in Chase et al. (2002) weakly link Elatinaceae and Bonnetiaceae +
Clusiaceae + Podostemaceae, but the evidence now suggests that Elatinaceae are sister to Malpighiaceae (Davis &amp; Chase 2004; Davis et al. 2005a; Tokuoka &amp; Tobe 2006; Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009), and some morphological data support this.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> The old Clusiaceae were strongly paraphyletic, so their continued recognition would entail the inclusion of Bonnetiaceae and Podostemaceae, and also Hypericaceae. For the "price" of recognizing Calophyllaceae, we have five coherent and moderately easy recognizable clades.</p>

<ul><li>Bonnetiaceae may be recognised by their long-pointed
buds, usually rather closely-set, spiral, short-petiolate and minutely-serrate
leaves. The moderate-sized flowers are
borne in cymose inflorescences, the corolla is contorted, the stamens are
numerous, and the septicidal capsules contain many small seeds.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Bonnettia</i> s.l. has trilacunar nodes, a mucilaginous epidermis, a
foliar endodermis, and foliar sclereids; <i>Archytaea</i> and <i>Ploiarium</i>
have unilacunar nodes and lack the distinctive epidermis, foliar endodermis and
sclereids (Dickison &amp; Weitzman 1996). The absence of any secretory system should be confirmed. Keller (1996) described the leaf vernation as being involute.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Bonnetia</i> also often has 3-trace petals while the bracetoles sometimes have only a single trace (Dickison &amp; Weitzman 1998). For <i>Archytaea</i>, Wawra de
Fernsee (1886) shows a floral diagram in which both the five carpels and the
stamen fascicles are drawn opposite the calyx. Ovule morphology in Bonnetiaceae
appears to be unknown.</p>

<ul><li>Clusiaceae range from shrubs or trees and some are
epiphytic; many are dioecious. The leaves are opposite and exstipulate, the blades are often thick, with entire margins,  and usually have resin
canals. A white or yellow exudate is very common. The flowers have free sepals and petals and
numerous stamens that are sometimes in fascicles. The fruit, when dehiscent, opens
along the septal radius. The seeds are small to large, arils being known from many New World taxa, and the embryos are often apparently undifferentiated - the cotyledons are small to almost absent and the
hypocotyl is enormous.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For discussion on an interesting and well-preserved late-Cretaceous fossil ca 90 m.y. in age that is possibly assignable to Clusiaceae, see Crepet &amp; Nixon (1998). The seeds are described as being arillate, but the morphology of the aril is unlike that of extant Clusiaceae (it is adjacent to the seed, rather than surrounding it), and it may even be an aborted seed.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> Variation in the androecium and gynoecium in <i>Clusia</i> and <i>Garcinia</i> in particular is extreme.  In <i>Clusia</i>, resins (polyisoprenylated benzophenones, mixed with fatty acids) are quite commonly a floral reward, and floral resin production may have evolved four times (as well as in <i>Clusiella</i> [Calophyllaceae]: Gustaffson &amp; Bittrich 2002). Euglossine and especially stingless <i>Trigona</i> (meliponine) bees have been observed at <i>Clusia</i> flowers, interestingly, species of <i>Clusia</i> at higher altitudes, where bees are less common, produce nectar as a floral reward (Armbruster 1984). In general, resins are an uncommon floral reward (but see also <i>Dalechampia</i> [Euphorbiaceae] and <i>Maxillaria</i> [Orchidaceae]). Fragrant oils are produced from the filaments of the flowers of <i>Tovomita</i>; these attract male euglossine bees, and the composition of the fragrances in three different species growing in the Ducke Nature Reserve was quite different (Noguiera et al. 1998). In <i>Symphonia</i> pollen is caught in a droplet that exudes through the pore at the tip of the stylar branches, and is sucked back into the pore (Bittrich &amp; Amaral 1996); the same unusual mechanism probably occurs in other Symphonieae all of which have similar stigmas.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Garcinia</i> is one of the five most diverse genera in West Malesian l.t.r.f. (Davies et al. 2005). <i>Clusia</i> is a very diverse genus and includes epiphytes and stranglers many of which are more or less leaf succulents, and a number of species grow at elevations up to 3500 m in altitude (Gustafsson et al. 2007). For the general ecology of <i>Clusia</i>, see papers in L&uuml;ttge (2007). Crassulacean acid metabolism has been reported from at least some of these epiphytes (Holtum et al. 2004), and its development may be promoted by phosphorus deficiency; whether or not the plant is mycorrhizal also affects the plant's phosphorus and carbon metabolism (Maiquet&iacute;a et al. 2009). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Roots of <i>Clusia</i>, at least, have superficial phellogen, as is fairly common in epiphytic taxa in general. For the morphology of the variable androecium in <i>Garcinia</i> and its immediate relatives, see Leins and Erbar (1991), Sweeney (2008, 2010) and Leal et al. (2012); the nectary is unlikely to be staminodial. Leal et al. (2012) and Tobe and Raven (2011) describe the ovules as being bitegmic (c.f. Corner 1976).</p>

<ul><li>Calophyllaceae are usually trees that may be recognised by their spiral to opposite,
exstipulate leaves with entire margins and pellucid dots or
canals; there is often some exudate from the cut twig. The flowers have free sepals and petals - usually white or pink - and
numerous stamens; the androecium is not obviously fasciculate, the anthers sometimes
have large, apical glands. The fruit, when dehiscent, opens
along the septal radius; the seeds
range from small to large, and when large, they are made up almost entirely of two
huge cotyledons.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Marila asymmetralis</i>, alone
in the whole family group, has obliquely monosymmetric flowers. The glands on anthers of genera like <i>Caraipa</i> are large, paired and crateriform, perhaps because the contents have been removed, while in other genera like <i>Kayea</i> they are small and rounded. Alternate-leaved genera form a clade; these
genera also have capsular fruits, often with winged seeds, and their embryos have cotyledons with cordate bases. Although <i>Calophyllum</i> has opposite leaves, a few species have seedlings with alternate leaves.</p>

<p>Synonymy: <b>Marathraceae</b> Dumortier</p>

<ul><li>Podostemaceae are the quintessential aquatic angiosperm
with a vegetative body so highly modified that conventional terms cannot be
used to describe it - the plant body of many taxa is best described as thalloid
or fucoid, although some species look like a demented apiaceous plant with
two-ranked leaves. Many species are
annual, and flowers or groups of flowers are often enveloped in a spathella;
the capsule is septicidal, and the small seeds are often mucilaginous.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Although there have been suggestions that Podostemaceae are attached to rocks by means of a special glue that they produce, it is more likely that it is materials in a biofilm produced by associated cyanobacteria that attach the plant to the substrate. There are hooked hairs on the lower side of the thallus that stick to the cyanobacterial filaments and associated biofilm. Indeed, these cyanobacteria may even produce nitrogen used by the plant; Podostemaceae usually grow in oligotrophic rivers flowing over gneiss or granite, being absent in rivers over limestone  (J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn &amp; Grubert 2000).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Some Podostemaceae self pollinate, the pollen tubes growing through the tissue of the flower to the ovules (Sehgal et al. 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is considerable variation (and a corresponding amount of controversy) over the development of the embryo sac in particular, perhaps especially in <i>Weddellina</i> (see e.g. Battaglia 1971; Arekal &amp; Nagendran 1975, 1977a, b; Nagendran et al. 1976; Murgu&iacute;a-S&aacute;nchez et al. 2002; Sehgal et al. 2011a). Is it mono- or bisporic, and does it have 3, 4 or 5 cells at maturity? However, there is general consensus that there is no double fertilization, the single polar nucleus degenerating (Sehgal et al. 2011b). During development of the embryo, the nucellus becomes amoeboid and is involved in the nutrition of the embryo; there are different pathways by which the nucellus becomes amoeboid (see J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn 1997). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For germination and establishment, see Grubert (1970, 1976); mucilage from the testa firmly attaches the seed to a rock. Although the embryo usually lacks a plumule and radicle, these were reported for <i>Malaccotristicha</i> sp. (Kita &amp; Kato 2005), and the seedling of <i>Zeylanidium olivaceum</i> has a hypocotyl; more information is needed on embryo morphology (but see Koi &amp; Kato 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> Interpretations of the plant body of Podostemaceae, the "thallus", vary, and saltational evolution has been invoked to explain how very different and distinctive morphologies in related taxa have evolved (Koi &amp; Kato 2010). It has been suggested that the thallus is a highly modified but ultimately fairly conventional plant body (J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn 2005), or that it cannot be compared with any other plant structure.  Since Podostemaceae are sister to Hypericaceae, detailed studies of the latter may provide clues for the evolution of the growth of the former, particularly building on the developmental studies of Katayama et al. (2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Podostemaceae with ribbon-like roots have opposite branching, those with a crustose or foliose growth form have endogenous shoots born singly on the upper surface. The evolution of the remarkable flattened roots of some Podostemoideae and Tristichoideae, which lack caps and have meristematic regions on both sides of the root, from the more ordinary-looking roots found in Weddelinoideae and some other Tristichoideae has been carefully documented by Koi et al. (2006). The exogenous or superficial origin of roots of some Podostemoideae is very unusual, since roots are normally endogenous, being initiated inside the pericycle; <i>Cladopus</i> has both exogenous and endogenous lateral roots (Rutishauser &amp; Pfeifer 2002). Whatever their origin, roots often have root caps.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The apex of the stem has a tunica-corpus construction. There is some controversy over whether normal axillary branching occurs or not (e.g. Rutishauser et al. 2005; J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn 2009a). Some taxa have shoots arising endogenously in the cortex (e.g. Moline et al. 2007). Dithecous leaves usually terminate growth of the axis that bears them; the leaf bases have two concave sheaths facing in opposite directions and in the axils of each a flower or branch bud arises (Rutishauser et al. 2003); for the optimisation of these dithecous leaves on a phylogeny of Podostemoideae, see Moline et al. (2007: note the adaxial position of the prophyll of the axillary dithecal vegetative shoot illustrated). J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn (2009b) also depicts the dithecous leaf as being adaxial on the axillary shoot that bears it.</b>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Katoyama et al. (2010) found from gene expression patterns in two Podostemoideae that it is almost as if a determinate "leaf" caps the indeterminate stem, new leaves/branches developing endogenously from the base of the "leaf". Since separation of the young "leaves" is by cell death, they will lack an epidermis, hence, perhaps, the absence of stomata in the subfamily - although they might be found on the flowers, in which there is more normal development (e.g. Katayama et al. 2008). The "epidermal" cells have dimorphic chloroplasts; smaller chloroplasts are found against the outer periclinal walls and much larger chloroplasts against the inner periclinal walls (Fujinami et al. 2011). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Grubert (1976) noted distinctive contents in cells of young plants of several Podostemaceae.  For SiO<sub>2</sub> bodies, see Machado da Costa (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The nature of the spathella is unclear. Unlike bracts in Podostemoideae examined, its development is that of a "typical organ of leaf homology" (Katayama et al. 2010, see also Katayama et al. 2008), although Eckardt and Baum (2010) suggest more specifically that it is calycine. However, if there is more than one flower per spathella, then it cannot be calycine. Some species of <i>Dalzellia</i> (Tristichoideae) have a cupule at the base of the pedicel that is formed by leafy shoot axes (Mathew et al. 2001).</b>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Tristicha</i> - A 1, adaxial, median carpel abaxial? (Schnell 1998). The
position of the stamens may suggest an obliquely monosymmetric flower (Cusset
&amp; Cusset 1988b), while Razi (1955; see also Endress &amp; Matthews 2006a) described the flowers of <i>Zeylanidium olivaceum</i>, which have a spathella, two stamens and two carpels, as being monosymmetric. There is sometimes an apical meristem in the vegetative body of Podostemoideae and the spathella may be produced by the connation of two foliar structures (J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn 2005b).  The outer integument develops early and the nucellus protrudes
beyond the inner integument. The amoeboid
nucellus has been described as a pseudo-embryo sac. Tobe and Raven (2011) describe the tegmen as being unspecialised.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Much information is taken from
Rutishauser (1997); see also Hegnauer (1969, 1990), Contreras et al. (1993) and Kato et al. (2005) - all these chemistry, Graham and Wood (1975), Barlow (1986: roots), Cusset and Cusset (1988a), Rutishauser and Huber (1991), Lobreau-Callen et al. (1998: pollen),

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> the basic phylogenetic structure of the family is [Tristichoideae [Weddellinoideae + Podostemoideae], all aldes with very strong support (Kita &amp; Kato 2001; see also Kita 2002: phylogeny and morphology; esp. Koi et al. 2012). See Moline et al. (2007) for the phylogeny and evolution of African Podostemoideae, Koi and Kato (2010) that of Asian Podostemoideae, and Koi et al. (2009) for that of Tristichoideae (and the description of a distinctive new genus), and Tippery et al. (2011) for that of New World Podostemoideae, where morphological analyses allowed the recovery of a few small generic clades, but molecular data resolved quite a number of nodes. The recently-described <i>Diamantina</i> appeared to be sister to all other Podostemoideae (Ruhfel et al. 2009), although that genus was not studied by Tippery et al. (2011), who found <i>Podostemon</i> and a paraphyletic <i>Mourera</i> as successively sister to the rest. Koi et al. (2012: very good sampling) confirmed the position of <i>Diamantina</i>, although support was weak; further large scale structure in Podostemoideae mostly had very little support, and monophyly of genera seems to be almost a foreign concept there, while groupings in Tristichoideae are well supported and genera are monophyletic.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Many genera are monotypic, the morphology of the thallus being so bizarre. For generic limits in some African Podostemoideae, see Thiv et al. (2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Prior to molecular work, systematists were largely at a loss as to where the relationships of Podostemaceae were to be found. The micropylar suspensor haustorium seemed like
that of Crassulaceae, perhaps suggesting a link between the two families (e.g. Les &amp; Philbrick 1996; Ueda et al. 1997a), but very different positions have also been suggested. Indeed, Podostemaceae have sometimes been set apart from all other angiosperms (e.g. Cusset &amp; Cusset 1988b). </p>

<ul><li>Putranjivaceae are trees to shrubs that may be recognised by their two-ranked,
often rather coriaceous and stipulate leaves that are asymmetric at the base and dry a
greyish color; they frequently taste peppery or like an inferior radish when
fresh, although this taste may take a little time to develop (mustard oils!). The
fasciculate flowers are frequently rather small and the single-seeded drupe is often crowned by the
persistent, flap-like stigmas.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> the age of Putranjivaceae is some 58 m.y. (Wikstrom et al. 2001). Some analyses suggest that the diversification rate in Putranjivaceae increased (Xi et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Perhaps not surprisingly, caterpillars of pierid butterflies have quite often (23/2690 records) been recorded eating Putranjivaceae (see also Brassicales and Fabaceae) - nothing so far is known about Lophopyxidaceae - species of the Indo-Malesian <i>Appias</i> subgenus <i>Catophaga</i> (albatrosses) feeding more or less indiscriminately on <i>Drypetes</i> (Putranjivaceae) and Capparaceae (Yata et al. 2010). In <i>Drypetes natalensis</i>, at least, consitutively-released isothiocyanates are part of the floral odour, but what exactly they do is unclear (Johnson et al. 2009a).</p>

<ul><li>Although hardly very distinctive, <i>Centroplacus</i> is a dioecious evergreen tree with serrate and stipulate leaves. It can be recognised by its branched inflorescences of small flowers; the staminate flowers have only five stamens in which the connective is well developed and the anthers dehisce by two oblique-apical slits.</ul>

<ul><li><i>Bhesa</i> species are usually evergreen trees with stipulate leaves (the stipules almost surround the stem) the blades of which are entire and have strong, regularly ascending secondary veins and distinctive closely scalariform tertiary venation; there is a pulvinus at the apex of the petiole. The flowers are small and are rather undistinguished, but the fruits are strongly bilobed and have arillate seeds.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Centroplacaceae may be sister to Ctenolophonaceae, diverging in the Cretaceous-Albian 111-100 m.y.a. ([109.6-]101.8[-96.6]/[97.1-]91.0[-88.1] m.y.: Davis et al. 2005a). Xi et al. (2012) found that diversification rate in this clade slowed down in some analyses.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> <i>Bhesa</i> is reported to be ectomycorrhizal (Smits 1994).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The ribbon-shaped exotegmic cells of <i>Bhesa</i> are longer than those of <i>Centroplacus</i>, and its integument is much thicker. The endostome of <i>Centroplacus</i> is lignified and more or less protruding.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Kubitzki (2013b), Pierre (1894), Ding Hou (1962, both <i>Bhesa</i>, and Wurdack and Davis (2009). For seed and vegetative anatomy of <i>B. ceylanica</i>, see <i>Jayasuriya &amp; Balasubramaniam 3107</i>, for seeds of <i>B. robusta</i>, see Corner (1976). For more information about <i>Centroplacus</i>, see Forman (1966: general), Stuppy (1996: seed anatomy and good discussion, not Euphorbiaceae s.l.), Tokuoka and Tobe (2001: seed anatomy, Euphorbiaceae-Phyllanthoideae, but with some doubt), and Radcliffe-Smith (2001: generic description). However, studies of the embryology, etc., of both genera are much needed.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> In a molecular study by Wurdack et al. (2004) <i>Centroplacus</i> was associated with Pandaceae, although with very little support, however, in Davis et al. (2005a) it is separate from Pandaceae and weakly associated with Ctenolophonaceae. Zhang and Simmons (2006) found that <i>Bhesa</i> fell among the few Malpighiales they included in their analysis of Celastrales, and Ken Wurdack (pers. comm.) suggested that a position around about here may be appropriate.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Recognising the two genera as a family seems most reasonable. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Although <i>Centroplacus glaucinus</i> was often placed in Pandaceae (Takhtajan 1997; Mabberley 1997), Webster (1994b)
and Radcliffe-Smith (2001) included it in Euphorbiaceae, but only with hesitation and with little certainty as to where it should be placed within the family. There is no obturator, unlike Euphorbiaceae. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Bhesa</i> was distinctive in
morphological analyses of Celastraceae, in which it used to be included (Simmons &amp; Hedin 1999; Matthews &amp; Endress 2005b), if sometimes with some doubt (e.g. Pierre 1894 [he thought it might be in a separate family]; Metcalfe &amp; Chalk 1950; Ding Hou 1962). Its huge stipules, distinct styles, vessels with scalariform perforation plates, etc., were somewhat out of place there, although Celastraceae were so heterogeneous that a strong case could not be made for its removal. The seed coat, with its massive exotegmic cells, is also very different, as is its pentalacunar nodes. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The common ancestor of these two families may have diverged towards the beginning of the Cretaceous-Albian at around 111-100 m.y., the Malpighiaceae and Elatinaceae themselves separating towards the end of this period some [113-]98[-89]/[100-]89[-85] m.y.a. (Davis et al. 2005a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Depending on the interpretation of variation, both the evolution of monosymmetric flowers and flowers with an inverted orientation can be pegged to this node (Zhang et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For the foliar glands and resin and latex production in Elatinaceae and Malpighiaceae, neither well understood, see Vega et al. (2002) and Davis and Chase (2004). Vega et al. (2002) suggested that the laticifers of Galphimieae might be a symplesiomorphy with Euphorbiaceae, although laticifers are not even an apomorphy of that family which anyhow is not immediately related to this group (see below); I know nothing of the composition of the latex of Malpighiaceae. Zhang et al. (2009a) surmised that the flowers of the ancestor of [Elatinaceae + Malpighiaceae] might have been monosymmetric.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For relationships between Malpighiaceae and Elatinaceae, see Davis and Chase (2004), Tokuoka and Tobe (2006), Korotkova et al. (2009), Wurdack and Davis (2009), Wang et al. (2009), Xi et al. (2012), etc. - support is strong.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> It had been suggested that Malpighiaceae were rather weakly associated with Peridiscaceae and were perhaps near Clusiaceae et al. (Chase et al. 2002); for the current position of Peridiscaceae, here in Saxifragales, see e.g. Davis and Chase (2004).</p>

<ul><li>Malpighiaceae are a distinctive family, with their usually
opposite, entire leaves with paired stipules (these vary in position). The unicellular hairs are T-shaped, often a characteristic brown,
and there are often conspicuous flat glands on the lower surface of the leaf blade or on the petiole. The flowers are characteristic: 4 or 5
sepals often have abaxial paired glands, the petals are strongly clawed and are
crumpled in bud, an adaxially-positioned petal often being a banner petal, and there are usually three carpels, each with a single ovule. The sepals and filaments often persist at
the base of the fruit, which is often a samara with a variable number of wings.
</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Malpighiaceae are known fossil from the Northern Hemisphere, e.g. from the Eocene Claiborne Formation in Tennessee, U.S.A., in deposits ca 34 m.y. old (Taylor &amp; Crepet 1987: <i>Eoglandulosa</i>, see also Friis et al. 2011). The rate of diversification may have increased in Malpighiaceae (Xi et al. 2012). An origin of the family in South America during the Late Cretaceous (ca 68 m.y. before present) has been suggested, with several - it now appears to be nine - subsequent dispersal events to the Old World followed by the loss of oil secretion by the sepals (Davis et al. 2002a, b, 2004; esp. Davis &amp; Anderson 2010). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology.</u> Malpighiaceae are one of the three ecologically most important groups of lianes in the New World tropics (see also Bignoniaceae-Bignonieae and Sapindaceae-Sapindoideae: Gentry 1991).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> The family is noted for having oil flowers, a trait that may have evolved 75-64 m.y.a. (Renner &amp; Schaefer 2010). Oil is secreted by paired calyx glands (epithelial elaiophores) and removed by the legs of the bees. Several genera of Apidae and Centridini-Anthophoridae are involved, and the latter, at least, grasp the narrow base of the banner petal of the functionally inverted monosymmetric flowers with their mandibles as they collect the oil from the glands, which are on the abaxial surface of the sepals; this banner petal is often distinctively coloured, and may change colour as it ages (Renner &amp; Schaefer 2010 and references). Oil is secreted in New World taxa only; some taxa there are buzz pollinated (Sigrist &amp; Sazima 2004). The flowers of Oncidiinae orchids may mimic those of Malpighiaceae, and sometimes they even provide fatty acids as a reward that are similar to those of Malpighiaceae (Reis et al. 2007). <i>Galphimia brasiliensis</i> may have small glands on the sides of the sepals towards the base; these glands have the same anatomy as glands on the margins of the leaf towards the base, and both secrete oil (Castro et al. 2001). However, Lobreau-Callen (1989) recorded the  leaf/bracteole glands of <i>G. bracteata</i> as producing sugars.</b>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In some Malpighiaceae growing in the Old World  the "oil" glands secrete nectar (Vogel 1974, 1990), although in most pollen is the only obvious reward (Davis &amp; Anderson 2010); the anthers may be porose. The orientation of the flowers has sometimes reverted to the normal condition for a core eudicot with the odd petal abaxial (Zhang et al. 2010). Flowers of Old World Malpighiaceae tend to be more or less polysymmetric, the petals are less strongly clawed, and the style branches longer and more widely spreading (Davis &amp; Anderson 2010 for illustrations).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Zhang et al. (2010) suggested that the functional inversion of the flower in New Worl Malpighiaceae is because of a 36<sup>o</sup> rotation of the flower; the result is that monosymmetry is associated with a monocot-type orientation of the flower, with the odd member of the inner whorl adaxial. There have been duplication(s) of <i>CYC</i> genes, although there is no local genome duplication, and <i>CYC2</i> genes are expressed only in the adaxial part of the flower in monosymmetric Malpighiaceae - although details of exactly when gene duplication occurred and what changes in pattern of gene expression there have been are unclear (Zhang et al. 2010). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Self-fertilization is common in species of <i>Gaudichaudia</i>, <i>Janusia</i> and relatives; it occurs by pollen tubes growing through the tissues of the flower to the embryo sac (Anderson 1980). Apomixis -
nucellar polyembryony - is common.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Acridocarpus</i>
has spiral, exstipulate leaves. Some species of <i>Stigmaphyllon</i> have leaves with palmate venation and toothed margins; some taxa, especially when young, have almost fimbriate lamina margins, albeit distantly so (the fimbriae are ca 4 mm long). Stipules are very
diverse, being petiolar in <i>Hiraea</i> and cauline in many vines and also in <i>Malpighia</i>;
in the latter genus they may be lobed or toothed.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The flowers of <i>Acridocarpus</i>
have an inferior ovary with only two fertile carpels. Testa anatomy may repay investigation. In <i>Mascagnia macrodisca</i> there is a layer of thin-walled, slightly elongated cells with brown contents over a layer of more or less isodiametric, lignified cells with somewhat more thickened and straight anticlinal walls; the latter layer has  a "frosted" appearance; the origin of these cell layers is not known (pers. obs.). Given that the main protective part of the propagule is not the seed coat, testa and tegmen may be rather reduced.  There are reports that <u>endo</u>tegmic fibres may be quite conspicuous (Silva &amp; Trombert 2006), but since fibres in other Malpighiales are exotegmic and Elatinaceae also have exotegmic seeds, what is going on in Malpighiaceae is unclear.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some information on chemistry is taken from Hegnauer (1969, 1989: iridoids have been reported from <i>Stigmatophyllum</i>) and on fruit and seed is taken from Takhtajan (2000). C. Anderson et al. (2006 onwards) provide general information, especially phylogeny and nomenclature, on <a href="javascript:showImage('http://herbarium.lsa.umich.edu/malpigh',600,500)">the whole family</a>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Information on relationships within
the family is taken from Davis et al. (2001) and Cameron et al. (2001); within Malpighiodeae, for the most part well-supported branches including <i>Acridocarpus</i>, <i>McVaughia</i>, <i>Barnebya</i>, <i>Ptilochaeta</i>, <i>Bunchosia</i> and <i>Hiraea</i> are successively sister to the remaining taxa. A recent study by Davis and Anderson (2010: four genes, all genera sampled) returned the same set of relationships, and with good support.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Malpighiaceae were included in Vochysiales by Takhtajan (1997) and in Polygalales by Cronquist (1981).</p>

<ul><li>Balanopaceae look like a <i>Myrica</i>, but they lack
its distinctive glandular hairs. The leaves are toothed, albeit sometimes minutely so, and are very coriaceous. The
staminate flowers are in catkins, the carpellate flowers are single and
surrounded by a cupule of spirally-arranged bracts. When dry, the cupulate, drupaceous fruits look somewhat like acorns; they have 2-3 stones.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Some analyses suggest that the diversification rate in Balanopaceae decreased (Xi et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The leaves are often described as
being dimorphic (Carlquist 1980; Cronquist 1983), but they are no more so than
in many plants that have bud scales. Cristarque cells occur in some species. Endress and Merino Sutter (2002) present details of the morphology of carpellate flowers; pollen descriptions in Feuer (1991) and
Herendeen et al. (1995) differ somewhat. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Relationships of Balanopaceae have long been problematic. Cronquist (1983) compared their wood
anatomy with that of Hamamelidaceae; Balanopales were included
in Daphniphyllanae by Takhtajan (1997). Merino Sutter and Endress (2003) suggested that the floral morphology of Balanopaceae is closer to that of Euphorbiaceae than to other families of this group.</p>

<ul><li>Trigoniaceae are evergreen trees that may be recognised by their simple, entire,
stipulate leaves that often have whitish indumentum below; dark glandular hairs or glands are common. The flowers are obliquely monosymmetric and are papilionaceous in their general appearance; the standard petal is more or less saccate or spurred.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Trigonia</i> has opposite leaves, interpetiolar stipules, and split lateral vascular bundles; lamina glands are not obvious. The bracts of <i>Trigoniastrum</i> are more or less glandular, with large glands on the abaxial surfaces, <i>Trigonia</i> has stalked glands variously on pedicels or petioles and margins of bracts and leaves, while <i>Humbertiodendron</i> has concave marginal glands towards the base of the leaf blades.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For floral morphology, I follow the
interpretations of Warming (1875) and Eichler (1878) rather than that of
Cronquist (1981). Schnizlein (1843-1870:
fam. 233) draws the flowers as being more or less vertically monosymmetric, while the orientation shown by Schatz (2001) is difficult to work out; in the latter it appears that the corolla may be quincuncial. Warming (1875) draws the nectary glands as
being part of the androecial whorl; Lleras (1978) describes them as being &quot;disc
glands&quot;.  In any event, the androecium at least sometimes seems to have more than 10 stamens. Testa anatomy is similar to that
of Linaceae, where there is similar variation in ovules but the two are not immediately related.</p>

<ul><li>Dichapetalaceae are trees or often lianes that may be recognised by their lenticillate twigs and stipules that are sometimes fimbriate, often dark
greyish-drying leaf blades with secondary veins that loop and join towards the margin; the venation is particularly
prominent on the abaxial surface, where there are also often flat glands. The inflorescences are cymose and &plusmn;
obviously epiphyllous, coming from the petiole; the small flowers have deeply bifid petals which dry
blackish, and in <i>Dichapetalum</i> at least, the flowers fall off in their entirety if not fertilized leaving the prominent pedicels behind. The fruit is a drupe that is often flattened and/or lobed and is covered by short, dense, erect hairs which often give a shiny, almost golden appearance.</ul>

<ul><li>Euphroniaceae are woody plants with entire, spiral,
stipulate leaves the lower surfaces of which are covered with whitish
indumentum; there are marginal abaxial glands near the base. The monosymmetric flowers
are distinctive in having a short hypanthium and only three free petals; the fruit
is a columellate, septicidal capsule and the seeds are winged.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Some analyses suggest that the diversification rate in Euphroniaceae decreased (Xi et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Ovule morphology, etc., of <i>Euphronia</i>
is still very poorly known. Lleras (1976) suggested that the (long)
staminode of <i>Euphronia</i> was in the position of the fertile stamen of
Vochysiaceae (that was a time when the two were thought to be related), Marcano-Berti (1995) that there is a staminal tube and four
stamens of two different lengths. Some information is also taken from Warming (1875: general), Barth (1896: general anatomy), and de Pernia and ter Welle (1995: wood anatomy). Some more data come from <i>Euphronia guianensis</i>: <i>Colonnello-Medina 712</i>, vegetative anatomy.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> <i>Euphronia</i> has been included
in Trigoniaceae (Airy Shaw 1966; Hutchinson 1973; Takhtajan 1997) or
Vochysiaceae (Cronquist 1981; Mabberley 1997). However, Euphroniaceae and Trigoniaceae differ in
a number of features, including those of wood anatomy (see Lleras 1976 for a table) and other aspects of vegetative anatomy (e.g. Trigoniaceae lack the mucilaginous hypodermis of <i>Euphronia</i>: Sajo &amp; Rudall 2002) and are not sister taxa.  </p>

<ul><li>The family can be recognised by its strongly lenticillate twigs and two-ranked,
often rather shortly petiolate and nearly always entire leaves; these either dry blackish grey
and/or have well-developed scalariform tertiary venation. The stipules are long and early deciduous, there are often broad, flat glands on the
abaxial surface of the lamina, and the petiole is more or less
swollen at one or both ends. The wood is very hard and  feels gritty when it is crumbled. The
flowers have a hypanthium, there are often many long stamens, the style is more
or less gynobasic, and the ovary is often borne on one side of the hypanthium. The one-seeded fruit is usually relatively
large and the endocarp is often conspicuously hairy inside.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Seed Dispersal.</u> For seed dispersal, generally by animals, see Prance and Mori (1983).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Syllepsis is uncommon both here (Keller 1994), and probably more generally in the whole group of five families.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For more information, see Morvillez (1918: petiole vasculature), Hegnauer (1973, 1990: chemistry), Badami and Patil (1981: seed fatty acids), Tobe and Raven (1984: embryology), Prance and White (1988: nicely illustrated variation in the family) and LaFrankie (2011: field characters).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> A recent molecular study (Yakandawala et al. 2010) yielded poor resolution of relationships, but suggested that groupings apparent in earlier morphological "taximetric" studies (Prance et al. 1969; Prance &amp; White 1988) should be reexamined. There is some support for <i>Atuna</i> being sister to the rest of the family (see also Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009); Sothers et al. (2014) found <i>Parinari</i> and <i>Maranthes</i> to be basal, although <i>Atuna</i> was not included; <i>Couepia</i> and <i>Licania</i> in particular, but also <i>Hirtella</i>, showed more or less extreme dgrees of para/polyphyly.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> The flowers of some Chrysobalanaceae look rather like those
of <i>Prunus</i>, and Chrysobalanaceae and Rosaceae were often considered to be
close (e.g. Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1997), either as separate families more or less adjacent in the sequence, or Chrysobalanaceae might even be included as a subfamily of Rosaceae. However, there are numerous differences
between them (see table in Prance 1972a). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> See Prance (1989: New World Taxa), and Prance and Sothers (2003a, b: world monograph). However, genera are being reorganized, see e.g. Sothers et al. (2014) for <i>Couepia</i>.</p>

<ul><li>Humiriaceae are evergreen trees that may be recognised by their blackish-drying,
short-petiolate, toothed leaves which elongate while still rolled up and often
have longitudinal lines down the abaxial surface of the blade; the buds on growing shoots are
long-pointed. The young twigs are angled, and in the juvenile forms of some species they are winged to winged. The cymose inflorescences
have rather small flowers with broadly rounded sepals, the filaments form a tube, and the anthers have conspicuously prolonged
connectives. The fruit is a drupe and
has a ridged or variously ornamented, operculate stone that often has cavities containing resin-like material.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Humiriaceae may have diverged from other Malpighiales in the Cretaceous-Albian 111-100 m.y.a. ([117.2-]112.2[-108.9]/[102.8-]101.6[-100.3] m.y.: Davis et al. 2005a). Herrera et al. (2010) rejected all fossils placed in this family other than some from South America, suggesting that the family originated there. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Seed Dispersal.</u> The fruits are dispersed by bats or by water, empty cavities in the stone affording bouyancy.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> There is no
endothelium. Although D. A. Link is sometimes cited as the author of a paper on the nectaries of Humiriaceae, and promised such a paper himself, it seems never to have appeared. </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some information is taken from Herrera et al. (2010: general), Mauritzon (1934d: ovules), Narayana and Rao (1977 and references: floral morphology),  Bove and Melhem (2000: pollen), and 
Boesewinkel (1985a: ovule and seed). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Within Humiriaceae, <i>Vantanea</i> is sister to the other genera; it has three or more staminal whorls (Bove 1997). Herrera et al. (2010: more detailed morphological analysis of 40 characters) suggested that <i>Vantanea</i> and <i>Humiria</i> were successively sister to the remainder of the family, although support for this topology was weak; the [<i>Humiria</i> + the rest] clade had quincuncial corollas and unilocular anthers.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Bove (1997) suggested that Ixonanthaceae were sister to Humiriaceae, both having ellagic acid, a "free" nectariferous disc encircling the ovary, and an undivided style with an entire stigma. Humiriaceae have also been linked with Linaceae and Erythroxylaceae, and thence to Geraniales (Narayana &amp; Rao 1978b), or the three families together are placed in Linales (Cronquist 1981).</p></p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> All six major clades in this group (Malesherbiaceae + Turneraceae + Passifloraceae, = Passifloraceae s.l., make a single clade) may have diverged in the Cretaceous-Albian 111-100 m.y.a., or somewhat later (Davis et al. 2005a, details are given for the individual clades); Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2001) suggest that many of the clades do not diverge until (well) after 63 m.y.a..</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Larvae of butterflies such as Nymphalidae-Acraeinae and N.-Nymphalinae-Heliconiini, -Vagrantini and -Argynnini commonly eat members of this group (Ehrlich &amp; Raven 1964; see also Dahlgren &amp; van Wyk 1988; Arbo 2006; Simonsen 2006; Silva-Brand&atilde;o et al. 2008; Nylin &amp; Wahlberg 2008; etc.); this is also discussed under individual families below. Some Acraeinae in particular may cue on the presence of the cyanogenic glucoside gynocardin in potential food plants, indeed, that larvae of <i>Acraea horta</i>, normally living on the woody <i>Kiggelaria africana</i>, ate herbaceous Achariaceae prompted the successful search for that compound in the latter family (Steyn et al. 2002). Toxic compounds like gynocardin may be sequestered by the larva and passed on to the adult. Interestingly, given the relationships evident in Wurdack and Davis (2008), the distinctive cyclopentenoid glycosides seem to have evolved more than once.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For relationships in this clade (= the parietal clade), which has strong support, see Xi et al. (2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> There is much information on seed
anatomy in Takhtajan (1992) while Krosnick et al. (2006) briefly discuss the evolution of polyandry in this group - in some cases, at least, the numerous stamens form a single whorl. See Mauritzon (1936b) for some information on embryology and Furness (2011) for pollen development and ultrastructure.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> It was commonly agreed that the old Flacourtiaceae presented major taxonomic problems. &quot;Flacourtiaceae as a family is only
a fiction; only the tribes are homogeneous&quot; (Hermann Sleumer, the monographer of the family, in Miller 1975: 79) - indeed, it was a fiction. Some of the old Flacourtiaceae
are now in Achariaceae, a few in Lacistemataceae, while Flacourtiaceae-Berberidopsideae are in Berberidopsidales (as Berberidopsidaceae) and <i>Aphloia</i> (Aphloiaceae) is in
Crossosomatales. The name Flacourtiaceae is now no longer in use, and remainder of this family is placed in Salicaceae. Variation in chemistry, leaf teeth, floral morphology, and seed coat anatomy is largely correlated with this division. When the possession of parietal placentation was considered to be very important, other families such as Caricaceae (Brassicales), Cucurbitaceae (Cucurbitales), etc., might also be grouped here.</p>

<ul><li>Achariaceae can be recognised by their stipulate leaves, often entire
leaf blades and pulvinate petioles; the crushed leaves may smell quite strongly of cyanide. In the flowers, the number of sepals and petals is often not the
same, and/or the perianth is not simply biseriate, and/or the petals have basal, adaxial scales. There is no nectary, and the anthers are usually long. The
fruits are often quite large, the placentation is parietal, and the seeds often
have conspicuous vascular bundles in the coat.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> The feeding behaviour of Acraeini butterfly larvae are consistent with the expanded family limits adopted here (Steyn et al. 2002, 2003 and references). Species of <i>Ryparosa</i> consistently produce food bodies, and in a number there are associations of varying closeness with ants (Webber et al. 2007).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> There are
large and medium intervascular pits; the wood also has solitary pores and lacks tracheids (Miller 1975). <i>Lindackeria</i> has superficial cork cambium. Pollen variation is considerable (Wendt 1988), as is that in ovule development and seed coat anatomy (Dathan &amp; Singh 1979;van Heel 1973 1974, 1977, 1979; Steyn et al. 2002a, b, 2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Information is taken from Hegnauer (1966, 1989, as Flacourtiaceae: chemistry), Endress and Voser (1975: floral development of <i>Caloncoba</i>), Spencer and Seigler
(1985b: chemistry), Lemke (1988), Gavrilova (1998: pollen), and Groppo et al. (2010: general); see also Judd
(1997a) and especially Chase et al. (2002). Bernhard and Endress (1999) discuss androecial initiation. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For the circumscription of Achariaceae, see Chase et al.
(2002) and Sosa et al. (2003): Acharieae (more or less herbaceous and viny; no testal bundles; zig-zag micropyle; fibrous exotegmen), Erythrospermeae (<i>Erythrospermum</i> - fibrous
exotegmen), Pangieae (inc. Kiggelarieae) and Lindackerieae (Oncobeae minus <i>Oncoba</i>). Note that the family is divided into three strongly-supported clades, largely <i>Hydnocarpus</i>, Erythrospermeae + Lindackerieae, and Acharieae + Pangieae, and support for monophyly of the family as a whole is strong (Sosa et al. 2003), Groppo et al. (2010) questioned some tribal limits in the family.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> I have not followed the classification in Chase et al. (2002) since the four tribes recognised there do not map (in terms of monophyly) on to the tree.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> The bulk of Achariaceae had almost
universally been included in Flacourtiaceae s.l. until recently (e.g. Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan
1997), most of which = Salicaceae, q.v. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Botanical Trivia.</b> Immature fruits of Australian <i>Ryparosa</i> have the highest concentrations of cyanogenic glucosides known - 12 mg g<sup>-1</sup> dry weight (Webber &amp; Woodrow 2004).</p>

<ul><li>Goupiaceae may be recognised by their two-ranked leaves with distinctive long-oblong, incurved stipules, ascending secondary veins and scalariform tertiaries. The angled pith is evident even in young plants. The inflorescence is umbellate and the petals are relatively long and inflexed at the apex. The gynoecium has five, widely separated styles; the fruit is a few-seeded berry.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  Diversification in the Goupiaceae clade seems to have slowed down (Xi et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The family is poorly known, especially embryologically.  It is often
suggested that only seedlings have dentate leaves, those of the adult being
entire, but leaves of flowering specimens are in fact frequently toothed. () noted that there was a lignified endocarp, so the fruit could technically be called a drupe.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Information on pollen is taken from
Lobreau-Callen (1977, 1980) and Furness (2011), on anatomy from den Hartog and Baas (1978), on the seed, from Takhtajan (2000: apparently not entirely accurate), and for general information, inc. anatomy, see Hoyos (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Cronquist (1981) included Goupiaceae in
Celastraceae, Takhtajan (1997) in Celastrales, A.-L. de Jussieu and others have
placed it in Rhamnaceae. Furness (2011: pollen size) suggested that Goupiaceae were closest to the Lacistemataceae-Salicaceae clade.</p>

<ul><li>Violaceae may be recognised by their serrate, stipulate
leaves which often dry yellowish and with raised venation, their flowers, which are often spurred and
have stamens with short filaments and very well-developed connectives that closely surround the gynoecium, and their fruit, which is
often a distinctive loculicidal capsule, the rather large seeds being dispersed explosively
as the fruit wall closes round them and squeezes them out. Plants are herbs, trees or lianes.</ul>

<ul><li><i>Melicytus</i> is woody,
dioecious, and baccate; the flowers are almost radially symmetric... Not surprisingly, woody Violaceae are quite commonly often
wrongly identified or not named at all, as Ron Leisner will confirm - however, the vegetative characters mentioned above do help.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  Marcussen et al. (2012) disentangle the complex reticulate history of the polyoploid northern hemisphere species of <i>Viola</i> where hybridization began ca 14 m.y.a.. This group includes the radiation on Hawaii (woody species!), the ancestry of which is to be sought in west North American species. The genus may have had its origin in Andean South America (Ballard et al. 1998).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Violaceae are the preferred hosts of the majority of fritillaries (Nymphalidae: Argynnini - see Simonsen 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Cleistogamy is widespread in <i>Viola</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The largely temperate <i>Viola</i> is myrmecochorous (Lengyel et al. 2010), and myrmecochory as well as dispersal by larger animals and by wind also occurs in more tropical taxa.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> <i>Viola tricolor</i>, the pansy, and the related <i>V. arvensis</i> were important subjects of early studies of genetics and speciation.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Inulin has been reported from <i>Hybanthus</i> (Beauvisage 1889). From the description of the root of <i>Ionidium</i> (= <i>Hybanthus</i>) <i>ipecacuanha</i> by Beauvisage (1889), the cork cambium may be mid-cortical or superficial. <i>Viola</i> has storied cambium.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For information on the flowers of <i>Fusispermum</i>, see Cuatrecasas (1950) and Hekking (1984), the former describes the scales as being ventral appendages of the connective.  Feng and Ballard (2005) suggested that even those Violaceae with polysymmetric adult flowers were monosymmetric earlier in development, so "flowers monosymmetric, at least in bud" may be an apomorphy for all/most of the family (see also Arnal 1946 for monosymmetry). The anthers and stigmas of many species are very complex (e.g. Kuta et al. 2012: <i>Viola</i>). In <i>Anchietea</i>
and <i>Decorsella</i> the seeds mature exposed on the open carpels.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For seed anatomy, etc., see Singh (1963), Singh and Gupta (1963), and Dathan and Singh (1974), for embryology, etc., see Singh (1970), for chemistry, see Hegnauer (1970, 1990), for cyclotides, see Burman et al. (2010), for information on the basal pectinations in the family, see Hoyos (2011), for general information, see Hekking (1988), Munzinger and Ballard (2003: also key to genera, two undescribed); see also Leins and Erbar (2010: flowers of <i>Viola</i>). An unpublished thesis by Feng (2005) includes a phylogeny of the family and details of the floral development of seven genera.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> There is good support for the relationships [<i>Fusispermum</i> [<i>Rinorea</i> + the rest]], with the old Leonioideae being embedded within Violoideae  (Tokuoka 2008, see also Feng &amp; Ballard 2005; Ballard et al. 2009).

<ul><li>Turneroideae are herbs to woody plants that may be recognised by their often very
hairy, serrate, exstipulate leaves with strong secondary venation. The flowers, with their calyx and corolla
together forming a tube, contorted and deliquescent yellow or sometimes red corolla, parietal
placentation, and often bifid, fringed stigmas, are distinctive. The loculicidally capsular fruits have
arillate seeds with a minutely and often regularly reticulate testa.</ul>

<ul><li>Malesherbioideae are more or less herbaceous, foetid and often densely glandular-hairy plants with distinctive flowers. The calyx and corolla together form a long tube; the sepals and petals
are both valvate. There is an
androgynophore, the floral tube is persistent in fruit, and the styles are
often subapical on the capsule.</ul>

<ul><li>Many Passifloroideae are tendrillar vines or lianes; the
leaves are alternate, stipulate, often with palmate venation, and often with glands on the lamina or
petiole. The axillary buds are
superposed, and the lower bud produces the inflorescence/tendril. The tendril is often oblique
to the axis; a flower may be lateral to it, or paired flowers are borne on it
or at its base. The
calyx and corolla are often similar and fused to each other at the base, and
there is usually a complex corona. There is a gynophore or androgynophore, often five stamens with large and versatile
anthers, and a three-carpellate gynoecium with parietal placentation. The fruit is often a berry, and the often flattened
seeds are arillate.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Most species of Turneroideae are New World, most genera are African; crown Turneroideae are dated to (42.5-)32.3(-42.5) m.y. (Thulin et al. 2012a). The rate of diversification may have increased in Passifloroideae or [Turneroidae + Passifloroideae] (Xi et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Thulin et al. (2012a) suggest that <i>Mathurina</i>, the only Turneroideae with wind-dispersed seeds, is older than the Rodrigues Island, to which it is now restricted.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> The cyclopentenoid glycosides common in Passifloraceae may be sequestered
by caterpillars feeding on the plants and perhaps used in defence and/or even as
nitrogen sources; Achariaceae also have such glycosides.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Caterpillars of <i>Heliconius</i> butterflies use <i>Passiflora</i> and its relatives as their main food (Fordyce 2010 for references and diversification rates). The plants show great variation in leaf morphology and foliar glands. Some of the glands are egg mimics (Vanderplank 2007 for references) and/or are epithelial extrafloral nectaries (Krosnick et al. 2011 for a summary), etc., indeed, it has been suggested that extrafloral nectaries are a key innovation for <i>Passiflora</i> (Krosnick et al. 2011). Butterflies lay eggs on plants that lack eggs, hence the mimicry of the glands. Heliconiine butterflies may have diversified on the foothills and lower sloped on the eastern Andes from Peru northwards (Rosser et al. 2012). <i>Heliconius</i> itself is also closely associated with <i>Psiguria</i> (Cucurbitaceae) and relatives, and perhaps some other plants, which it pollinates; unusually, the pollen is a source of nutrients for the butterfly. The larvae of some Acraeinae, another nymphalid butterfly, and also of brightly-coloured Notodontidae-Dioptininae (moths) are also often found on <i>Passiflora</i> (Miller 1992; Silva-Brand&atilde;o et al. 2008), and at least the former are also found on <i>Barteria</i>. Turneroideae are the hosts of caterpillars of several genera of Nymphalidae, alternate hosts include Salicaceae, Passifloroideae, and Violaceae (Arbo 2006 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Details of the association between the African ant-plant <i>Bartera fistulosa</i> and the ant <i>Tetraponera aethiops</i> are given by Dejean et al. (2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> For the considerable anatomical variation in <i>Adenia</i> as well as variation in life form, see Hearn (2006, 2009a); Hearn (2009b) suggested that the place of development of vascular strands and associated parenchymatous storage tissue in root and/or stem varied spatially in the plant, hence helping to generate the diversity of growth forms in the genus.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> A little is known about the development of the complex series of fimbriae and membranes at the base of the androgynophore and on the KC tube in <u>Passiflora</u>. In subgenus <u>Passiflora</u> at least, genes normally involved in stamen development are expressed in the centripetally developing fimbriae, although the limen, a rim structure at the base of the androgynophore protecting the nectar, is from this point of view an organ <i>sui generis</i> (Hemingway et al. 2011). Species of <i>Passiflora</i> like <i>P. ampullacea</i> have monosymmetric flowers, with stamens, etc, adaxially positioned, and in at least some of these species the odd sepal is abaxial (Macdougal 1994, they also have four carpels); <i>P. unipetala</i> has but a single petal in the adaxial position. Sazima and Sazima (1978) note that the bat-pollinated flowers of <i>Passiflora mucronata</i> become zygomorphic as the stamens move after the flowers opens (see also Endress and Matthews 2006a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">It has been suggested that there is floral mimicry between <i>Turnera</i> and Malvaceae in Argentina (Benitez-Vieyra et al. 2007).  Heterostyly is common in <i>Turnera</i>, <i>Piriqueta</i> and some other genera of Turneroideae. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Myrmecochory occurs in <i>Turnera</i> (Lengyel et al. 2010).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Cyanogenic glycosides in this family have a variety of precursors, both protein and non-protein amino acids  (Miller et al. 2006 for references); glycosides of individual groups may be distinctive, e.g. Malesherbioideae, which has teraphyllin (Spencer &amp; Siegler 1985a).</p>  

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Cronquist (1981) suggested that Malesherbioideae lack
stipules. In species of <i>Passiflora</i>
with strongly bilobed leaves, vernation may be modified conduplicate: The blade
makes a V with an inverted V at the end of each arm. The tendril is an axillary shoot and flowers can arise from
prophyllar buds on it. For the floral and extrafloral nectaries of Passifloraceae, see Krosnick et al. (2008a, b, 2011). The latter are anatomically quite different from the former (i.a. they lack nectarostomata) and the <i>CRABS CLAW</i> genes is not expressed in them (Krosnick et al. 2008a), and so they are arguably not "homologous". </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Species of both <i>Turnera</i>
and <i>Piriqueta</i> have epiphyllous flowers. Although the tubular flowers of Passifloraceae s.l. are often described as having a hypanthium, the tube is nearly always formed from calycine and corolline elements only.  For androgynophore evolution, see Tokuoka (2012). The styles of Malesherbioideae are shown as being commissural by
Schnizlein (1843-1870: fam. 198). For a discussion on aril development, see Kloos and Bouman (1980); although the aril is often described as funicular, they incline to call it raphal. Turneroideae have biparental or
paternal transmission of plastids, as may Passifloroideae (Shore et al.
1994). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The old Flacourtiaceae-Paropsieae (<i>Barteria</i>, <i>Paropsia</i>, etc.) are to be included with Passifloroideae (Chase et al. 2002). Anatomically the two are rather similar, indeed, the major variation in the subfamily seems to be associated with habit - lianes versus trees (Ayensu &amp; Stern 1964). <i>Passiflora</i> and its immediate relatives have stem collenchyma, cymose inflorescences, and branches developing from an accessory (superposed) bud, as is common in taxa that have axillary tendrils with non-basal prophyllar buds. In Passifloreae these prophyllar buds may produce additional tendrils, hence branched tendrils, or flowers. <i>Adenia</i> is rather different from other Passifloroideae, perhaps being more like the two other subfamilies, e.g. in having an only moderately developed corona and tricolporate pollen (e.g. see Feuillet &amp; MacDougal 2006). <i>Adenia</i>  also thas a nectary often made up of
separate glands, a hollow style, and its stigma lacks multicellular papillae
(Bernhard 1999a, c), in addition, it may be dioecious, it lacks an
androgynophore, its stamens are sometimes connate, it may have a gynophore, and
some species have a true hypanthium (de Wilde 1971b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Do the sieve tubes have non-dispersive protein bodies? </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In Passifloreae, carpel orientation
is taken from Le Maout and Decaisne (1868) and Schnizlein (1843-1870: fam. 197); for pollen, see  Presting (1965) and Spirlet (1965), for chemistry, see Hegnauer (1969, 1990), for embryology, etc., see Raju (1956a) and Singh (1970), for branching, see de Wilde (1971a),  for anatomy, see Harms (1893), for stipules, see Dahlgren and van Wyk
(1988), and for general information, see de Wilde (1974) and Feuillet and MacDougal (2006).  For general information on Paropsieae, see de Vos and Breteler (2009). Some information on Turneroideae is taken from Raju (1956b) and Vijayaraghavan and Kaur (1967), both embryology and seed, Hegnauer (chemistry), Gonz&aacute;lez and Arbo (2005: anatomy) and Gonzalez et al. (2012: <i>Aldenoa</i>, general), and Arbo (2006: general account). General information on Malesherbioideae is taken from
Ricardo S. (1967, he suggested that the micropyle is endostomal) and Kubitzki (2006b); for chemistry, see Hegnauer (1969, 1990). Embryologically Malesherbioideae are largely unknown.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For floral anatomy of <i>Passiflora</i>, see Puri (1947), for floral morphology, see Endress (1994b), and  for floral development, see Krosnick et al. (2006); for a general account of the genus, see Ulmer and MacDougal (2004). Hansen et al. (2006) discuss chromosome number evolution, n = 12 may be the basal number; see also de Melo and Guerra (2003) and Mayrose et al. (2010).</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Turneraceae were weakly associated with Malesherbiaceae in Chase et al. (2002), the two being strongly associated with Passifloraceae. Although preliminary data seemed to suggest that a paraphyletic Passifloraceae might include Turneraceae and Malesherbiaceae (A.P.G. II 2003), Korotkova et al. (2009: only three taxa from the three families) found that <i>Turnera</i> and <i>Passiflora</i> were sister and with 98% jacknife support. For relationships in the clade that are the same as those shown above, see Tokuoka (2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Arbo and Espert (2009: morphological analysis, basally pectinate tree with little support) discuss the morphology and biogeography of <i>Turnera</i>; Thulin et al. (2012a) disentangled relationships within Turneroideae, finding three or so links across the South Atlantic and several African genera forming a distinct clade. For relationships within Malesherbioideae, see Gengler-Novak (2002, 2003), and for those within Passifloroideae, see Tokuoka (2012). For a phylogeny of <i>Passiflora</i>, see Yockteng and Nadot (2004), Krosnick and Freudenstein (2005: also morphology), and Krosnick and Freudenstein (2006). See Hearn (2006) for a phylogeny of <i>Adenia</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Including Turneraceae and Malesherbiaceae in Passifloraceae s.l. is an optional arrangement in A.P.G. II (2003), and given the basic similarity of the three families, they were placed in one by A.P.G. III (2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a revision of <i>Turnera</i>, see Arbo (2008 and references). <i>Passiflora</i> includes <i>Hollrungia</i> and <i>Tetrapathea</i> (Krosnick &amp; Freudenstein 2006); for a formal infrageneric classification of <i>Passiflora</i>, see Feuillet and Macdougal (2004).</p>

<ul><li>Lacistemataceae are woody, evergreen plants that have stipulate and usually serrate leaves. The small flowers are borne in rather dense racemes to spikes and have an inconspicuous perianth and a single anther whose two thecae are often well separated and even stipitate. The dehiscent fruit is small, with one, sometimes to three, apical seeds.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Chirtoi&uuml; (1918) described the flower as having 4-5 free perianth parts and an irregularly lobed disc. The presence of an aril in Lacistemataceae needs to be confirmed (see also Corner 1976).  Sleumer (1980) records one for <i>Lacistema</i>, but a fleshy seed coat for <i>Lozania</i>; an aril seems obvious in neither.  In the latter genus there appear to be long "hairs" inside the fruit which perhaps support the dangling seed; these hairs are thick-walled but unlignified cells that may be derived from the funicle (see also <i>Casearia</i>, Salicaceae). However, the embryology, etc., of the family are largely unknown.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Additional information from: <i>Lozania</i> - <i>Riviere 270</i> (anatomy), <i>Gentry et al. 22231</i> (fruit); <i>Lacistema</i> - <i>Aymard &amp; Delgado 6882</i> (fruit), <i>Rimachi Y. 11201</i> (anatomy - stomata tending to anisocytic). See Young (2007 onwards: <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.lacistemataceae.org/',600,500)">Lacistemataceae website</a>, focus is on  species, nomenclature, etc.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Lacistemataceae do not cluster with the rest of
Salicaceae and Kiggelariaceae (Savolainen et al. 2000a), although they are probably in this area (Chase et al. 2002; see also D. Soltis et al. 1999, 2000). Davis et al. (2005a) place them as sister to Salicaceae s.l. (61% bootstrap, 1.0 posterior probability), as do Korotkova et al. (2009: slightly higher jacknife); as might be expected, they lack salicoid teeth.</p>

<ul><li>Salicaceae can be recognised by their alternate,
serrate, stipulate leaves often with distinctive "salicoid teeth"; these latter have a small vein proceeding into the tooth, where it expands, the apex of the tooth being a variously coloured spherical gland or stout hair. The flowers often have many spreading stamens and a
commonly three-carpellate gynoecium with parietal placentation and either
separate styles or a long, persistent style; the fruit is often a capsule. When there are both sepals and petals, the two whorls are in a regular
alternating arrangement, and the nectariferous disc or nectar glands are often outside the stamens. A number of
taxa have pellucid foliar glands (<i>Abatia</i>, <i>Casearia</i>, <i>Ryania</i>,
<i>Zuelania</i>).</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Boucher et al. (2003) described  <i>Pseudosalix</i>, an Eocene fossil from North America, which is morphologically intermediate between <i>Salix</i> and more florally conventional Salicaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Diversification in Scyphostegioideae seems to have slowed down (Xi et al. 2012: as Scyphostegiaceae).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> <i>Populus</i> is dioecious and wind-pollinated. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> <i>Salix</i> and its immediate relatives enter into a variety of associations with fungi, including ectomycorrhiza1 and endomycorrhizal, and there may also be dark septate endophytes (e.g. Van der Heijden 2000; Becerra et al. 2009). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Boeckler et al. (2011) discuss the anti-herbivore properties of the phenolic glycosides characteristic of <i>Salix</i> and its immediate relatives, nevertheless, a number of insects and fungi are associated with these plants and their immediate relatives. <i>Phyllonorycter</i> leaf-mining moths (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae: Phyllocnistinae) are sometimes found on <i>Populus</i> and <i>Salix</i> (Lopez Vaamonde et al. 2006). Ehrlich and Raven (1964) noted that caterpillars of <i>Atella</i> (Nymphalinae) feed on Flacourtiaceae and Salicaceae, while some Notodontidae moths (Miller 1992); rusts (e.g. <i>Melampsora</i> spp. on <i>Salix</i>, <i>M. idesiae</i> on <i>Idesia</i> - Holm 1979), etc., show
similar host patterns.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some hundreds of species of gall-forming sawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae: Nematini) are by far the most common on <i>Salix</i> and <i>Populus</i> among their angiosperm hosts, although they have yet to be recorded from other Salicaceae s.l. (Roininen et al. 2005). Unlike other galls, sawfly-induced galls result largely from stimuli provided by the ovipositing wasp, which may inject fluids into the plant, rather than from the activities of the larvae, so the galls assume their mature forms before the eggs hatch (Redfern 2011).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> There is a gene duplication in the common ancestor of <i>Salix</i> and <i>Populus</i>, the salicoid duplication, that has been dated to 65-60 m.y. (Tuskan et al. 2006); it will be interesting to know if other Salicaceae s.l. have it. <i>Populus</i> has lost the <i>PHYC</i> gene (Matthews 2010 and references); again, the phylogenetic extent of this loss is of interest.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The [Salix + <i>Populus</i>] clade is dioecious, and  an x/y sex determination system has evolved at least three times (twice in <i>Populus</i> - aspens and poplars) in the clade, maybe within the last 7-6 m.y. - although the whole clade is  at least 25 m.y.o. (Geraldes et al. 2015; see also Filatov 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Salix</i> is notorious for extensive interspecific
hybridisation .</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Banara</i> is the only genus
reported to have cyanogenic glycosides, but it is well embedded within
Salicaceae (Chase et al. 2002). The perforation plates of the tracheary elements are more or less
simple and the intervascular pits are small. <i>Xylosma</i>, <i>Flacourtia</i>, etc., have
groups of large sclereids in the phloem (Zahur 1959). <i>Xylosma</i> and some <i>Casearia</i> seem to have unilacunar
nodes. Leaf traces arise an internode
below the leaf they innervate in <i>Hasseltia</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Casearia</i> can have phyllanthoid branching, the orthotropic axes having spirally arranged and reduced leaves while the plagiotropic branches are sylleptic and have fully-expanded and two-ranked leaves. <i>Abatia</i>
has opposite leaves with at most very small stipules and marginal glands at the
base of the lamina. Salicoid leaf teeth are quite variable, but all have secretory palisade cells over parenchyma and are well supplied by vascular tissue, especially xylem (Wilkinson 2007). Thadeo et al. (2008; see also Thadeo &amp; Meira 2009) discuss the similarity between leaf teeth and foliar nectaries in Salicaceae, in particular the foliar nectaries of <i>Prockia crucis</i> that secrete fructose, glucose, sucrose, etc. Nectaries at the base of the lamina in two species of <i>Populus</i> differed markedly. In one they were persistent, with continuous nectar flow, while in another, large amounts of nectar were produced over a short time and cell death occurred, but new nectaries could be produced (Escalante-P&eacute;rez et al. 2012). There are also taxa with pli-nerved leaf blades and foliar
glands in Salicaceae - this is a vegetatively rather heterogeneous clade.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The valvate perianth members of <i>Abatia</i> are basally connate and bear
many filamentous processes, and the flowers lack a nectary. In those species that have a nectary, its morphology is very variable. It is often
made up of a number of lobes, and these may be intrastaminal. It has been claimed that the nectary of <i>Salix</i> represents a member of the perianth, but Alford et al. (2009) suggest that it is like that of other members of the family; there are &plusmn; receptacular nectaries associated with the stamens in taxa in the clade sister to [<i>Salix</i> + <i>Populus</i>]. Elongated embryo sacs occur in both Salicaceae and old Flacourtiaceae (Steyn et al. 2005a), indeed,  the embryo sac more or less protrudes into the micropyle in <i>Archevaletaia</i> (Maheshwari 1950). Corner (1976) described the micropyle of <i>Scyphostegia</i> as being exostomal. The exotegmen of <i>Dovyalis</i> consists of ribbon-like cells.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> It had been observed in the past that Salicaceae s.
str. and Flacourtiaceae-Idesieae were very close, despite the catkins of the former - they both have similar, distinctive leaf teeth,
phenolic-type compounds such as salicin are found here only, etc. (Miller 1975), and as just noted, rusts and caterpillars, perhaps keying in on chemical characters, show similar distributions (e.g. Meeuse 1975).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Chase et al.
(2002) have greatly clarified the phylogenetic situation in the old Salicaceae-Flacourtiaceae area (see also Judd 1997a; Nandi et al. 1998; T. Azuma et al. 2000; Savolainen et al. 2000a), although sampling within tribes still needs to be
extended. <i>Casearia</i>, which lacks salicoid leaf teeth and has apetalous flowers with a nectariferous area on the basal-adaxial surface of the perianth tube, is sister to the
rest of Salicaceae, although support for this position is weak (Chase et al. 2002, c.f. D. Soltis et al. 1999, 2000).  Relationships around <i>Salix</i> are [<i>Microhasseltia</i>, etc. [[<i>Salix</i> + <i>Populus</i>] [<i>Olmediella</i> [<i>Bennettiodendron</i> + <i>Idesia</i>]]]; characters like hairy seeds, sepals deciduous in fruit, loss of corolla, and dioecy are apomorphies at various levels within this clade (Alford et al. 2009). For a phylogeny of <i>Salix</i>, see T. Azuma et al. (2000) and Chen et al. (2010). <i>Trichostephanus</i> (Trichostephaneae) was
not assigned to any family (Chase et al. 2002), but in lacking petals and in having a disc at the base of the calyx it is like <i>Casearia</i> (Samydeae). <i>Oncoba</i> is remarkably like other members of the erstwhile Oncobeae (see now Achariaceae - Lindackerieae), but they differ in chemistry, leaf tooth type, and stamen initiation; it is perhaps to be assigned to Flacourtieae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Leskinen and Alstr&ouml;m-Rapaport (1999) discussed the relationships of <i>Salix</i> and its immediate relatives.</p>

<ul><li><i>Salix</i> and <i>Populus</i>: cuticle waxes as rosettes of platelets, or 0; inflorescences
catkinate; P much reduced; <u>G [2]</u>, collateral, ovules usu. unitegmic; seeds
with long placental hairs at base; embryo green. These are mostly derived features.</li></ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Chase et al. (2002) provide a detailed tribal classification for the clade: Abatieae,
Bembicieae, Prockieae (inc. Banareae), Oncobeae (<i>Oncoba</i>
only), Homalieae, Saliceae, Samydeae
(Casearieae), Scolopieae, and Scyphostegieae. These tribal limits may well have to be adjusted, thus Saliceae will probably have to be expanded, but note Flacourtieae  are polyphyletic, etc. The classification is only partly adopted here pending more detailed sampling. Alford (2003) recognised three families for the New World genera previously included in Flacourtiaceae - in addition to Achariaceae, Berberidopsidaceae and Lacistemataceae. Salicaceae have dilated stigmas and sometimes lack sepals, while Flacourtiaceae s. str. have attenuate, lobed, or capitate stigmas and petals present or absent. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Generic limits in the <i>Casearia</i> group neeed attention (Samarakoon et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> In the Englerian system <i>Salix</i> was often kept with the wind-pollinated Amentiferae, not at all close to Flacourtiaceae, a family that was also recognised at the time and which encompassed the bulk of Salicaceae above and also Achariaceae, etc. See Gilg's (1914) emphatic rejection of Hallier's suggestion that there might be a link between <i>Idesia</i> (Flacourtiaceae) and Salicaceae.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Lee et al. (2011) found that genes involved in oxygen and radical detoxification clustered at this node, but <i>Populus</i> and <i>Bruguiera</i> were the only other members of Malpighiales in their study. On strict parsimony grounds the distinctive fruits of Euphorbiaceae, etc., could be a synapomorphy for the whole clade, and then lost, or acquired twice; in any case, these fruits have been lost within Euphorbiaceae s. str., etc.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> This one clade includes the extremes of flower size in angiosperms. Pseudanthia have evolved ca 4 times, and in <i>Euphorbia</i>, for example, a single stamen represents the staminate flower. In <i>Rafflesia</i>, on the other hand, the flower can be up to 1.5 m across (e.g. Barkman et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Note that many of the features mentioned above are lost in Rafflesiaceae.  The exotegmen there is described as having U-shaped thickenings, and the exotegmen of some Peraceae can also look U-shaped in transverse section (see illustrations in Tokuoka &amp; Tobe 2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b>  Barkman et al. (2004a) sequenced the mitochondrial gene, <i>mat</i>R, of <i>Rafflesia</i> and found a strong association with Malpighiales (see below for previous placements of Rafflesiaceae). Although sampling within Malpighiales (only three taxa with parietal placentation were studied) and other rosids was poor, Barkman et al. (2004) noted that the flowers of <i>Rafflesia</i> could be interpreted as having a number of features in common with those of Passifloraceae, including a corona (called a diaphragm by students of Rafflesiaceae), androgynophore, parietal placentation (but this is common in echlorophyllous parasites), etc. As Nickrent et al. (2004a) pointed out, the "homology" of these structures needs careful examination. Davis and Wurdack (2004: two nuclear, one mitochondrial [<i>mat</i>R] genes), with considerably more extensive sampling, but also confirming a position in Malpighiales, favoured a position closer to Ochnaceae, Clusiaceae and their relatives, and tenuinucellate ovules are common there, too - however, it is quite common for holoparasitic taxa to lack parietal tissue in their ovules...  Many of the analyses carried out by Nickrent et al. (2004a) also suggested a position of Rafflesiaceae in or near Malpighiales. Most recently, Davis et al. (2007), using largely mitochondrial genes, exemplars of all families of Malpighiales, and a good sample of Euphorbiaceae s.l. (including three of the four genera of Peraceae, <i>Chaetocarpus</i> only excluded, Euphorbiaceae-Cheilosioideae also included), located Rafflesiaceae within Euphorbiaceae and with quite good support (see also Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b>  Merino Sutter and Endress (1995) argue for
a rather broadly delimited Euphorbiaceae (inc. both Phyllanthaceae and
Putranjivaceae), Huber (1991) for a narrower circumscription, with the
biovulate taxa (Phyllanthaceae, Picrodendraceae,
Putranjivaceae) being considered to be closer to Linales s. str., while Meeuse
(1990) also suggested that the family should be split - into eleven families. There is no molecular evidence yet for a broadly delimited Euphorbiaceae (unless Linaceae et al. are to be included), yet Euphorbiaceae s. str, Phyllanthaceae and Picrodendraceae all have a similar and rather distinctive capsule, etc. (see also Merino Sutter et al. 2006). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Splitting Peroideae from the other Euphorbiaceae s. str. - which actually makes the latter more homogeneous in fruit and testa anatomy - and keeping Rafflesiaceae seems reasonable, there being little enthusiasm for including a Rafflesioideae within an already large Euphorbiaceae.</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Many details of anatomy, and in particular floral development, ovule morphology, etc., are poorly known.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Neither wood anatomy nor pollen morphology are distinctive (Nowicke et al. 1998; Hayden &amp; Hayden 2000), however, members of Peraceae are variously described as having lysigenous radial canals in the wood, laticiferous cells, and elongated cells with brown contents. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The highly reduced flowers of <i>Pera</i> are surrounded by coloured inflorescence bracts; a pseudanthium of sorts. <i>Pogonophora</i> has adaxially barbellate petals. Style branches are variable in this group, being very short to longer and bifid. The seeds are described as having arils by Tokuoka and Tobe (2003). The anatomy of the seed coat of Peraceae is distinctive compared to that of Euphorbiaceae s. str. - this from an earlier version of /APweb/: "Tokuoka and Tobe (2003) note some Acalyphoideae with a distinctive seed coat anatomy - a more or less tracheoidal exotegmen - unlike that of all other Euphorbiaceae (minus Phyllanthaceae, etc).  Interestingly, all the taxa involved belong to other families or are in Euphorbiaceae-Peroideae.  These are sister to other Euphorbiaceae, and the distinctive exotegmen structure is more like that common in other Malpighiales.  So it is possible that this is plesiomorphic, whereupon the palisade exotegmen of <i>Pogonophora</i> is a parallelism..."  The seed coat anatomy of <i>Trigonopleura</i> is unknown.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For pollen, see Nowicke et al. (1998), for wood anatomy, see Hayden and Hayden (2000); for seed coat anatomy, see Huner (1991) and Tokuoka and Tobe (2003); for general information, see Webster (1984) and Radcliffe Smith (2001). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Tokuoka and Tobe (2006) question the inclusion of <i>Pogonophora</i> in this clade; indeed, if it is to be included and is sister to other Peraceae, then mapping seed coat evolution on the tree does become a bit tricky. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For a comprehensive checklist and bibliography, see Govaerts et al. (2000, in Euphorbiaceae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Although Airy Shaw (1976) recognised Peraceae as separate from Euphorbiaceae, his Peraceae included only <i>Pera</i>, a genus long considered very distinctive within Euphorbiaceae, even if rarely separated from it. Esser (2003) drew attention to the distinctiveness of the whole group.</p>

<ul><li>Rafflesiaceae s. str. are stem or root
parasites on <i>Tetrastigma</i> (Vitaceae) lacking leaves, rhizomes and roots. The large to massive flowers are usually imperfect and have an often uniseriate and basally-fused perianth; there are 12-40 extrorse stamens adnate to
a central column in the staminate flowers and the carpellate flowers have an inferior ovary.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The age of stem Rafflesiaceae may be (109.5-)95(-83.1) m.y., that of the crown group (95.9-)81.7(-69.5) m.y.a., however, diversification with each genus did not begin until very much later, that in <i>Rafflesia</i> at a mere (15.1-)11.8(-9.2) m.y. being the first - there may have been an extinction event immediately prior to this (Bendiksby et al. 2010, which see for more dates, 95% H.P.D.; see also Barkman et al. 2008). Note that if <i>Sapria</i> split off from other Rafflesiaceae ca 81.7 m.y.a. (Bendiksby et al. 2010) there must have been a major reorganization of the plant body in less than 15 m.y. after Rafflesiaceae split from Euphorbiaceae s. str. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> The flowers of at least some Rafflesiaceae are thermogenic (Seymour 2001) and pollination, where known, is by flies (Davis et al. 2008). There was a ca 79-fold increase in flower size during the evolution of stem-group Rafflesiaceae over a period of ca 46 m.y., an increase perhaps linked to the adoption of sapropmyophily; size increase in the subsequent ca 60 m.y. was much more modest  (Davis et al. 2007, 2008). However, in a more extensive study of <i>Rafflesia</i>, Barkman et al. (2008) suggested that there had been very considerable changes in flower size even within the last 12 m.y. or so, the age of crown group <i>Rafflesia</i>, with repeated both considerable increases and moderate decreases in flower size. Ancestral flower size was (very approximately) 29 cm across (Barkman et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Rafflesia</i> - Rafflesiaceae in general - are parasitic on species of <i>Tetrastigma</i> (Vitaceae), an association that has evolved more than once (P. Chen et al. 2011a). P. Chen et al. (2011b: HPD) suggest ages of (65.3-)50.6(-36.4) m.y. for stem <i>Tetrastigma</i>, (49.3-)36.9(-25.7) m.y. for the crown group, well before diversification of <i>Rafflesia</i>. However, if the whole family is parasitic on <i>Tetrastigma</i>, there is an interesting timing problem... The vegetative plant body of Rafflesiaceae is endophytic, and Wurdack and Davis (2009) suggested that it might be derived from laticiferous tissue, however, the common ancestor of Euphorbiaceae and Rafflesiaceae are not likely to have had laticifers.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Davis and Wurdack (2004) found that the sequence of another mitochondrial gene (<i>nad1</i>B-c) that they sequenced strongly suggested a relationship between Rafflesiaceae and Vitaceae; the presence of this gene in Rafflesiaceae they reasonably thought was caused by horizontal gene transfer from Vitaceae. Xi et al. (2012a) have since shown that slightly over 2% of the genome may be involved, some <i>Tetrastigma</i> genes functioning in their host, and in a number of vertically transmitted <i>Rafflesia</i> genes, codon usage seemed to be <i>Tetrastigma</i>-like, perhaps facilitating the close association of the host and endophytic parasite - certainly the closest integration of host and parasite genome known in  land plants.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The plant is tanniniferous (Gottlieb et al. 1989). Although there are stomata in <i>Rafflesia</i>, they are clearly abnormal, having three or more guard cells (Cammerloher 1920).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">What the perianth represents is still unclear.  If <i>Sapria</i> is interpreted as having a biseriate perianth (the spreading lobes of the flower), then the annular diaphragm in the middle is "coronal" in nature. However, in <i>Rafflesia</i> the tubular structure below the diaphragm seems to have an inner and outer portion, suggesting that the spreading lobes represent the calyx and the diaphragm the connate corolla (D. Boufford, pers. comm.)... <i>Rhizanthes</i> lacks a diaphragm. Furness and Rudall (2004) note a very distinctive combination of microsporogenesis and pollen morphology for the family, but for pollen morphology, see also Blarer et al. (2004). The outer integument, when present, is one cell
layer thick, but it is not easy to interpret the ovule (see Solms-Laubach 1874; Ernst &amp; Schmid 1913 for more details). Although the funicle is bent, the integument is not adnate to it; in taxa with a single integument, there is a swelling on the chalaza, perhaps an indication of the other integument. During germination of some <i>Rafflesia</i>, at least, the seed is anchored onto the host by sticky endosperm tubules and also the embryonal primary haustorium, the whole thing looking rather like a T4 bacteriophage (Arekal &amp; Shivamurthy 1976).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For additional information,
see Harms (1935a: general), Takhtajan et al. (1985: pollen),
Bouman and Meijer (1986: seeds, 1994: ovules and seeds), Meijer (1993: general), Nais (2001: general, superb photographs), the <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/',600,500)">Parasitic Plants website</a> (Nickrent 1998 onwards: general) and also Heide-J&oslash;rgensen (2008: general).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Relationships within Rafflesiaceae are [<i>Sapria</i> [<i>Rhizanthes</i> + <i>Rafflesia</i>]] (Davis et al. 2007).

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Rafflesiales of some authors included a number of echlorophyllous, parasitic groups including Cytinaceae (here Malvales), Apodanthaceae (Cucurbitales), Mitrastemonaceae (Ericales) and of course Rafflesiaceae itself. Many early and more recent authors have sought an affinity between Rafflesiaceae and taxa like Aristolochiacaeae (references in Takhtajan 1997), perhaps in part because of a belief that the pollen of the former had only a single aperture, as did that of Aristolochiaceae; there is a gynostemium of sorts and extrorse anthers in both. Cocucci and Cocucci (1996) saw connections of Rafflesiaceae first with Apodanthaceae and then with Annonaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Determining the phylogenetic relationships of Rafflesiaceae has been difficult. Apart from the distinctive and often hard-to-interpret morphologies of the families involved, molecular analyses have been problematic in part because of the very long branches in some genes and the general problem of obtaining suitable sequences from holoparasites (e.g. see results from analysing sequences of the mitochondrial <i>atp</i>1 gene - Nickrent et al. 2004a).  Indeed, when representatives of all four families are included, an apparently monophyletic Rafflesiales s.l. may be recovered (Nickrent et al. 2004a). Nickrent (2002) had suggested that Rafflesiaceae themselves might be close to Malvales, however, other analyses, including those in which not all members of the erstwhile Rafflesiales were included at one time, suggest a break-up of the group (see also Barkman et al. 2004; Davis &amp; Wurdack 2004; Nickrent et al. 2004a; Davis et al. 2007; Filipowicz &amp; Renner 2010).</p>

<ul><li>Euphorbiaceae may be recognised by the leaves on the
one branch often being variable in size and/or shape, the secondary veins are
often &plusmn; palmate, the margins are toothed, and there are sometimes glands of various kinds. Cauline stipules are common, as is latex
(the latter not in Acalyphoideae). The
plants are mono- or dioecious, the flowers are small, the perianth usually
inconspicuous, there are usually three carpels with prominent stigmas, and the
fruits have a distinctive and persistent columella, large and often carunculate
seeds (one per loculus), and explosive dehiscence. Euphorbiaceae are quite often poisonous.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Euphorbiaceae may have diverged from other Malpighiales in the Cretaceous-late Aptian ([119.4-]113.8[-110.7]/[105.9-]101.6[-101.1] m.y.: see Davis et al. 2005a). An estimate for the crown group age of the family is ca 102 m.y. (van Ee et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Diversification within Acalyphoideae occurred within the last ca 70 m.y. (Davis et al. 2005a), while the stem and crown group ages for <i>Croton</i> are ca 55 and ca 40 m.y. respectively (van Ee et al. 2008). A <i>Mallotus</i>-<i>Macaranga</i>-like plant has been found in deposits from New Zealand that are about 23 m.y. old - this clade is not currently known from the islands (Lee et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Divergence within Euphorbieae may have begun (63.5-)48.9(-40.5) m.y.a. (Bruyns et al. 2011); <i>Euphorbia</i> itself started diverging (47.2-)36.6(-29.0) m.y.a., or earlier than 42.5 m.y.a. (van Ee et al. 2008: subgenus <i>Esula</i> not included.) There seems to be but a single origin of the distinctive cyathium here (Park &amp; Backlund 2002; Wurdack et al. 2005), and although the cyathium characterises a very species-rich clade, diversification may also be associated with the evolution of a variety of distinctive life forms and seed dispersal types and the adoption of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (see below).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Caterpillars of nymphalid butterflies are quite common on Euphorbiaceae (Ehrlich &amp; Raven 1964), e.g. caterpillars of the ca 340 species of Biblidinae are found on <i>Dalechampia</i> and <i>Tragia</i> (DeVries 1987; Wahlberg et al. 2009). Caterpillars of the spectacular Uraniinae moths can be found on <i>Endospermum</i>, <i>Omphalea</i> and <i>Suregada</i> throughout the tropics (Lees &amp; Smith 1991); the first two are rather closely related, the position of the last is unclear (Wurdack et al. 2005). It would be interesting in this context to clarify both Euphorbiaceae phylogeny and Uraniinae host plant preferences.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In Malesia about 29 species of fast-growing, large-leaved <i>Macaranga</i> are the ecological analogues of the New World <i>Cecropia</i> (Urticaceae); for a phylogeny, see B&auml;nfer et al. (2006). Food bodies (Beccarian bodies) and extra-floral nectaries provide food for the ants (<i>Crematogaster</i> spp.), which live in obligate association with the plants in their hollow stems which are either hollowed out by the ant or become hollow as the stem ages; mymecophytism seems to have evolved more than once here (Hatada et al. 2001 for references; Feldhaar 2003a, b). The association with the ants is some 20-16 m.y. old. <i>Coccus</i> scale insects provide carbohydrates for the ants, but that association  is only 9-7 m.y. old (Ueda et al. 2008). Other members of this association include <i>Arhopala</i> (a lycaenid) caterpillars which eat ant larvae but are not attacked by the ants, rather, the products of a tentacle-like gland that is extruded by the caterpillar calm the ants (Maschwitz et al. 1984). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Complex maytansinoids, ansamycin antibiotics, that are likely to be synthesized by fungal endophytes or other plant associates, are found in <i>Trewia</i> (Cassady et al. 2004 for references). The fungus <i>Uromyces pisi</i> causes <i>Euphorbia cyparissias</i> to form nectar-producing pseudoflowers that facilitate transmission of the fungus spermatia (Pfunder &amp; Roy 2000).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Flowers of Euphorbiaceae are generally small, and pseudanthia have originated more than once (and also in Peraceae).  <i>Euphorbia</i>, with some 2,400+ species, is by far the biggest clade with cyathia. The distinctive nectar-secreting glands on the bracts subtending the cyathium may be modified commissural stipules (Steinmann &amp; Porter 2002), while the cyathium itself seems to be a modified cymose inflorescence with a single, terminal, carpellate flower (c.f. <i>Jatropha</i>, etc.); details of its development are provided by Prenner and Rudall (2007), although they found that the morphological nature of both cyathial glands and the petal-like bracts surrounding the cyathium was unclear (see also Hoppe 1985 and Prenner et al. 2008b). Indeed, at the level of gene expression, "floral" genes may be expressed in the cyathium as a whole (Prenner et al. 2011).</b>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The ca 115 species of <i>Dalechampia</i> (Acalyphoideae) also have remarkable pseudanthia. Here female megachilid, euglossine and stingless <i>Trigona</i> (meliponine) bees visit the "flowers" for resin they use to build their nests (resin is a very uncommon reward in flowering plants, see Armbruster 1984, 1996, 2012 for details and references). The resin has secondarily become used for defence in some species, probably its original fuction (Armbruster et al. 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The evolution of the distinctive red, spurred, monosymmetric cyathia in New World species of <i>Euphorbia</i> that used to be segregated as <i>Pedilanthus</i> has been studied from the point of view of whether or not they represent a "key innovation" (Cacho et al. 2010): Bird pollination occurs here. The jury is out, but there aren't many species in this clade... Pollination by thrips (Thysanoptera) seems to be particularly common in myrmecophytic species of <i>Macaranga</i> (Fiala et al. 2011); 24/29 species may be so pollinated, based on floral morphology, about double the frequency when compared with non-myrmecophytic species of the genus growing in the West Malesian localities that Fiala et al. visited.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Seed dispersal is initially usually by the explosion of the capsule, the seed being hurled quite some distance - to 45 m in <i>Hura crepitans</i>, the sand-box tree (Swaine &amp; Beer 1976). The seeds especially of <i>Euphorbia</i> may have nutritive arils or caruncles (e.g. R&ouml;ssler 1943) which facilitate further local dispersal of the seeds, especially by ants; a total of ca 2300 species in the family, many in <i>Euphorbia</i>, are likely to be myrmecochorous (Lengyel et al. 2010), and caruncles may have evolved ca 13 times there (Horn et al. 2012). In <i>Euphorbia</i> subgenus <i>Chamaesyce</i> section <i>Anisophyllum</i> in particular a number of species have testas that become mucilaginous when wetted (Jordan &amp; Hayden 1992).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> "Euphorbiaceae", i.e. including Phyllanthaceae, Putranjivaceae, etc., are often the second most abundant family in tropical rainforests in South-East Asia and Africa (Gentry 1988).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Both growth patterns and carbon fixation pathways show much diversity, particularly in <i>Euphorbia</i>. Basic relationships here are [<i>Esula</i> [<i>Rhizanthium</i> [<i>Euphorbia</i> + <i>Chamaesyce</i>]]] (subgeneric names, see Bruyns et al. 2011, also below). Diversification is estimated to have begun ca 42.5 m.y.a. (van Ee et al. 2008: probably earlier, subgenus <i>Esula</i> not included; Horn et al. 2012), but other estimates are (47.2-)36.6(-29.0) m.y.a. (Bruyns et al,. 2011). Divergence within the largely succulent subgenera <i>Rhizanthium</i> and <i>Euphorbia</i> began somewhat less than 30 m.y.a., (38.2-(28.1(-22) and (39.6-)29.9(-22.5) m.y. respectively, with much speciation in the latter subgenuus in particular occuring within the last ca 13 m.y. (Bruyns et al. 2011). <i>Euphorbia</i> s. str. (i.e. not including <i>Chamaesyce</i>, etc.) alone is extremely variable (Keller 1996), but with the inclusion of <i>Chamaesyce</i> and other segregate genera (e.g. Horn et al. 2009a, 2012) there is yet more diversity. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Both the cactiform life form and the annual habit, the latter in <i>Euphorbia</i> subgenera <i>Chamaesyce</i> and <i>Esula</i>, seem to be associated with much speciation (Horn et al. 2009a, 2010b); the annual habit has evolved eight times or more in subgenus <i>Esula</i> alone (Frajman &amp; Sch&ouml;nswetter 2011). Stem succulence in <i>Euphorbia</i> - some are quite massive stem succulents - is associated with the evolution of a monopodial growth form and axillary inflorescences (Horn et al. 2012); these plants are cactus-analogues of drier areas throughout Africa and into India and even beyond (Steinmann &amp; Porter 2002; Bruyns et al. 2006, 2011). Succulent <i>Euphorbia</i> is a particularly prominent component of the winter rainfall vegetation of the Succulent Karoo of south west Africa (Nyffeler &amp; Eggli 2010b). All told, some 850 species belonging to all four subgenera are succulents; xeromorphism of one form or another has evolved ca 14 times (Horn et al. 2012), but subgenera <i>Rhizanthium</i> and <i>Euphorbia</i> are made up mostly of succulent species, and they lack any annuals (Bruyns et al. 2011; Morawetz &amp; Riina 2011). Succulence is of various types. The plants may have variously articulated or simply pencil-like stems, the latter as in some species of subgenus <i>Chamaesyce</i>, or they may be medusoid, with relatively slender but succulent branches radiating from a stout central axis, and they may be spiny (in subgenus <i>Euphorbia</i> there are spine shields; there are also stipular spines, as well as spines in the stipular position that are not actually vascularized) or thorny (see e.g. Park &amp; Jansen 2007; Carter 2002, esp. illustrations; Bruyns 2010). Bruyns et al. (2011) describe the different forms of stem succulence found in the genus in detail, and they note that in a number of species of subgenus <i>Euphorbia</i> the branches become permanently differentiated; orthotropic axes will not develop from branches. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Given the prevalence of succulence in <i>Euphorbia</i>, it is not surprising that crassulacean acid metabolism is quite common in the genus. It has evolved ten times or so, especially notable cases being in subgenera <u>Rhizanthium</u> and <u>Euphorbia</u>, the two subgenera in which the succulent habit is particularly common (Horn et al. 2010b; Bruyns et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Most of the ca 350 species of subgenus <i>Chamaesyce</i> section <i>Anisophyllum</i> carry out C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, a syndrome which probably originated a single time there (Yang &amp; Berry 2011a; Yang et al. 2012). Maximum estimates of the age of origin of the pathway are (13.1-)10.4(-7.3) m.y. (Christin et al. 2011b). Some C<sub>4</sub> species grow in the more arid parts of Africa and are also succulents. Horn et al. (2012) emphasize that it is not simply the evolution of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway, but also the adoption of a plagiotropic branching habit, etc., that may have made this clade successful, as well as its movement from the Old to the New World (see also Yang &amp; Berry 2011b). Species of section <i>Anisophyllum</i> growing on Hawaii form a distinctive woody radiation and include some of the largest C<sub>4</sub> plants anywhere, being trees up to 9 m tall growing in mesic forests (Pearcy &amp; Troughton 1975; see Winter 1981 for slightly larger C<sub>4</sub> Chenopodioideae); Horn et al. (2012) discuss how the tree habit might evolve in a clade in which all branches are basically plagiotropic. This Hawaiian clade appears to have evolved from within a small clade of weedy annuals now found in Southern USA, Mexico, and the Caribbean (see also Yang et al. 2009); hybridisation is involved in their origin, and it is also known from elsewhere in the C<sub>4</sub> clade (Yang &amp; Berry 2011b). The whole plant body of some species in section <i>Anisophyllum</i> can be compared with the inflorescence of other species of <i>Euphorbia</i>; the seedling apex aborts after the production of a single pair of leaves, and several axillary shoots showing complex determinate branching produce the adult plant (Hayden 1988).  There are many different starch grain morphologies in the latex of species in this clade (Biesboer &amp; Mahlberg 1981).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The C<sub>4</sub> clade probably evolved in drier areas of North America, and it is sister to the small subsection <i>Acutae</i> from southwest North America in which there are C<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub> species, although only species with the latter two kinds of photoynthesis have been sequenced (Yang &amp; Berry 2011a, esp. b; Yang et al. 2012). Sage et al. (2011) described C<sub>2</sub> photosynthesis in subsection <i>Acutae</i>, and they noted that <i>E. angusta</i>, with C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis, had some anatomical similarities with C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> taxa; it is in a small clade from southwest North America sister to the other C<sub>4</sub> species. </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> There is great diversity in phorbol esters in the [Crotonoideae + Euphorbioideae] clade. Cyanogens in Euphorbiaceae s. str.
can be derived from nicotinic acid or valine/isoleucine (Seigler 1994); latex
and cocarcinogens are both apparently restricted to Euphorbioideae and
Crotonoideae. Distinctive fatty acids in the seed oils are quite common in the family (Badami &amp; Patil 1981); for lectins, see Vandenborre et al. (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Laticifers in Euphorbiaceae are discussed by Rudall (1987, 1994a) and Wiedenhoft et al. (2009); see also the cautionary comments in Wurdack et al. (2005). Biesboer and Mahlberg (1981) describe the complex morphology of the starch grains found in the latex of <i>Euphorbia</i> and laticifer evolution there. <i>Claoxylon</i> has distinctively rough leaves when dry because of the styloids in their tissues (Kabouw et al. 2008). Prismatic crystals in wood parenchyma and/or ray cells are common, and these also occur in Putranjivaceae and Picrodendraceae (Hayden 1994).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Prenner et al. (2008a) described the development of the distinctive androecium of <i>Ricinus</i> with its branched stamens which, however, are not cauline as has been suggested. Some Euphorbiaceae are reported to have two vascular traces supplying each ovule (Venkata Rao &amp; Ramalkshmi 1967). Johri and Kapil (1953) describe the vascular tissue in <i>Acalypha indica</i> as proceeding one third the way up the nucellus. The projecting nucellus in <i>Codiaeum variegatum</i>, at least, seems to result from periclinal divisions of the epidermal layer of the nucellus, the nucellar cap, although in <i>Euphorbia</i> less striking projections seem to be the result of divisions of the underlying nucellar cells (Bor &amp; Kapil 1975 and references). Mennega (1990) suggested that the subdermal initiation of the inner integument separated Euphorbiaceae from other families.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Van Welzen (1994) described <i>Neoscortechinia</i> (Cheilosoideae) as having a thin, red aril, but no aril was mentioned by Tokuoka and Tobe (2003) or Tokuoka (2007).</b>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information on Euphorbiaceae, see Webster (1967, 1994a, b - also other papers

(2009: leaf anatomy of some Acalyphoideae), and Fiser Pecnikar et al. (2012: leaf anatomy of <i>Mallotus</i> and relatives). For pollen morphology of Crotonoideae in particular, see Lobreau-Callen et al. (2000), for that of Acalyphoideae s.l., see Nowicke and Takahashi (2002) and references, for that of <i>Acalypha</i>, see Sagun et al. (2006), and for that of Plukenetieae and Euphorbieae, see Su&aacute;rez-Cerbera et al. (2001).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Molecular analyses by Wurdack and Chase (2002) and especially Wurdack et al. (2005, see also Tokuoka 2007) suggest that substantial changes may be needed in the groupings currently recognised in the family. The beginning of the reclassification they suggest is given here, with the interpolation of Rafflesiaceae as suggested by Davis et al. (2007) and the associated recognition of Peraceae; the main problem remaining is the circumscription of Crotonoideae.  </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although there are number of distinctive features in the Crotonoideae as broadly construed, there is as yet no evidence that it is monophyletic (see the C<sub>1-5</sub> clades in the tree, the C<sub>1-2</sub> clades are the same as in Wurdack et al. 2005), and many of the characters in the subfamilial characterization above are synapomorphies either for individual clades or groups within them (the latter the <i>trn</i>L-F spacer deletion - a feature of part of Crotonoideae s. str.). Crotonoideae s. str., the C<sub>1-2</sub> clades, may expand from this minimalist circumscription as details of phylogenetic relationships are clarified, and for the most part they have petals, distinctive inaperturate pollen with supratectal processes, and the tegmen is usually vascularized. The pollen of <i>Suregada</i> (Crotonoideae:  C<sub>1</sub> clade) is pantoporate and it also
lacks columellae. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The large genus <i>Croton</i> is being actively studied by Berry and collaborators (see Berry et al. 2005; van Ee et al. 2008, 2011; van Ee &amp; Berry 2009; Riina et al. 2009, 2010; Caruzo et al. 2011 for phylogenies, dates, biogeography, and more). <i>Croton</i> and immediate relatives can be quite readily recognised: Some leaves turn orange with age, the indumentum is stellate-lepidote, there are distinctive often yellowish glands on the petiole, and the stamens are inflexed in bud.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although Acalyphoideae in the old sense is paraphyletic, the great bulk of the subfamily is included in a single, strongly-supported clade, Acalyphoideae s. str. The plesiomorphic thickness of the outer integument may be 6-10 or so cells across, but Tokuoka (2007) noted that Adenoclineae and Gelonieae have a thinner outer integument, and they may form a paraphyletic grade at the base of Acalyphoideae, albeit currently this topology has very little support. Slik et al. (2001: morphology), Sierra et al. (2006, 2010 and references [the latter with symmetric resampling values and both qualitative and quantitative variation used]) and Kulju et al. (2007a, b) evaluate the phylogeny of the <i>Macaranga</i>-<i>Mallotus</i> complex; there are three main clades, and in <i>Mallotus</i> s. str. in particular some small, segregate genera are embedded. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a phylogeny of <i>Euphorbia</i>, see Molero et al. (2002: Macaronesian taxa), Bruyns et al. (2006), Park and Jansen (2007), Zimmermann et al. (2010) and  Wurdack et al. (2011). The last three authors found that subgenus <i>Esula</i> was sister to The Rest, although not always with very strong support - relationships are [<i>Esula</i> [<i>Rhizanthium</i> [<i>Euphorbia</i> + <i>Chamaesyce</i>]]] (see also the extensive study by Bruyns et al. 2011; Horn et al. 2012). Sampling was initially poor, however, this has steadily improved. Some characters are particularly common/important within the subgenera, although there is very extensive homoplasy. A few of the major characters are [<i>Esula</i> (annuals, cyathium with 4 glands) [<i>Rhizanthium</i> (cyathium with 5 glands, inflorescences sometimes lateral, plants succulents) [<i>Euphorbia</i> (inflorescences often lateral, plants succulents) + <i>Chamaesyce</i> (annuals, C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, leaves often opposite)]]] (Horn et al. 2012, q.v. for references and many more details).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For relationships in <i>Euphorbia</i> subgenus <i>Esula</i> in particular, see Frajman and Sch&ouml;nswetter (2011: position of <i>E. lathyris</i> unclear; also summary in Geltman et al. 2011), and for those in subgenus <i>Rhizanthium</i>, in which the only Malagasy species, <i>E. antso</i>, is sister to the rest, see Morawetz and Riina (2011). For relationships in the mostly New World subgenus <i>Chamaesyce</i>, see Yang and  Berry (2007, 2011) and Yang et al. (2012), and for those in subgenus <i>Euphorbia</i>, see Dorsey et al.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For a comprehensive checklist and bibliography of the family, now dated, see Govaerts et al. (2000), while Radcliffe-Smith and Esser (2001) describe the genera. For an outline of the classification of the speciose <i>Macaranga</i>, seee Whitmore (2008). For information on <i>Euphorbia</i>, see the developing site <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.euphorbiaceae.org',600,500)">EuphORBia</a> (Esser et al. 2009) and there is an inventory, etc., of the genus, at <a href="javascript:showImage('http://app.tolkin.org/projects/72/taxa',600,500)">Tolkin</a> (Riina &amp; Berry 2012), but not if you use Internet Explorer only... <i>Euphorbia</i> is best broadly circumscribed, so including the whole of the Euphorbiinae of Webster (1994b), i.e. genera like <i>Chamaesyce</i>,
<i>Pedilanthus</i>, <i>Monadenium</i>, <i>Synadenium</i>, etc., and is well characterized by the possession of a cyathium (e.g. Bruyns 2010 and references); Yang et al. (2012) provide a classification of <i>Euphorbia</i> subgenus <i>Chamaesyce</i>. For generic limits in the <i>Macaranga</i>-<i>Mallotus</i> area, see Kulju et al. (2007a) and Sierra et al. (2007), and for a sectional classification of <i>Croton</i>, see van Ee et al. (2011).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Cronquist's Euphorbiales included Simmondsiaceae (Caryophyllales here), Pandaceae (Malpighiales) and Buxaceae (Buxales), whilst Takhtajan's (1997) Euphorbianae included
Pandaceae and Dichapetalaceae (Malpighiales), as well as
Thymelaeaceae (Malvales) and Aextoxicaceae (Berberidopsidales), but these are clearly groups that have little to recommend them.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> The clade [Phyllanthaceae + Picrodendraceae] had only very slight support in a <i>rbc</i>L analysis, although the two families have morphological similarities (Wurdack et al. 2004). Support is stronger (75% bootstrap, 1.0 posterior probablility) in a recent 4-gene analysis (Davis et al. 2005a; see also Tokuoka &amp; Tobe 2006; Korotkova et al. 2009) and even stronger in Soltis et al. (2011). Thus the two are probably sister taxa. </p>

<ul><li>Phyllanthaceae have a variety of growth forms, but can be recognised by their often
finely-cracking bark, absence of latex, and leaves that are often two-ranked, entire, stipulate, pinnately-veined
and usually without glands. Monoecy is widespread, the flowers are small, and the explosively dehiscent fruit have a persistent
columella; there are two ovules/seeds in each carpel.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> <i>Lachnostylis</i>, a small Cape genus, seems to be a relict element there, being dated to as much as 97 m.y.a. (Warren &amp; Hawkins 2006), while Haegens (2000) discusses the distribution of the <i>Baccaurea</i> group as being initially the result of drift events occuring ca 80 m.y.a.. These ages should be re-examined. For the possible (post-)Miocene E->W dispersal of <i>Bridelia</i> across the Indian ocean, see Li et al. (2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Species of the African-Madagascan <i>Uapaca</i> are ectomycorrhizal (Ducousso et al. 2008) and can locally dominate the vegetation in Madagascar; on Africa they are often a component of Detarieae-dominated woodlands and savannas (White 1983). Ectomycorrhizae sometimes occur along with arbuscular mycorrhizae (Ba et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> In a clade of some 500+ species of <i>Breynia</i>, <i>Phyllanthus</i> and <i>Glochidion</i> pollination mutualisms involve the moth genus <i>Epicephala</i> (Gracillariidae: Kato et al. 2003; Kawakita &amp; Kato 2004a, b, 2006; Kawakita et al. 2004; Svensson et al. 2010); the plants involved are all part of <i>Phyllanthus</i> s.l. (see below). Flowers in which the moth lays eggs lose all their seeds to the growing caterpillars, but the moth pollinates more flowers than it lays eggs in. These mutualisms seem to have evolved both more than once and also some time after the divergence of the clade in which they are found - 55.2-33.4 m.y.a. (plant) versus 35-20 m.y. (moth) ago - and they have also been lost (Kawakita &amp; Kato 2009; Kawakita 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> Phyllanthoid branching occurs in many, but not all, species of <i>Phyllanthus</i> s.l. (Kathriarachchi et al. 2006). The orthotropic axes have reduced, spirally-arranged leaves and the plagiotropic axes usually have two-ranked, photosynthetic leaves and flowers in the axils of those leaves; the latter axes are of more or less limited growth. The plagiotropic lateral branches of <i>P. acidus</i> may be short-lived and lack flowers, so being the functional equivalent of compound leaves; the flowers themselves are borne on short branches lacking photosynthetic leaves and which arise from separate axillary buds. Some Caribbean species are yet more modified. Thus the plagiotropic lateral branches of <i>P. epiphyllanthus</i> are cladodes and bear flowers and fruits in the axils of scale leaves on either side of the cladode. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The only record of cocarcinogens is
from one species of <i>Antidesma</i> (Beuteler et al. 1989). Wood
anatomy is variable (Hayden &amp; Brandt 1984) and the nodes are quite often unilacunar (Thakur &amp; Patil 2002).</b>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The inflorescence of <i>Uapaca</i> is a pseudanthium. The pollen is very variable in <i>Phyllanthus</i> in
particular (Webster 1956). The outer integument is
variable in thickness.  The fruit type of the ancestor of Phyllanthaceae is unclear (Kathriarachchi et al. 2005). The exotegmen is most often described as being ribbon-like or tracheoidal.  However, Hymenocardieae (<i>Didymocistus</i>, <i>Hymenocardium</i>) have a collapsed tracheoidal exotegmen and large tanniniferous endotegmic cells; do they belong here (Tokuoka &amp; Tobe 2001)? - yes, say Wurdack et al. (2004) and Kathriarachchi et al. (2005).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For additional information, see also K&ouml;hler (1965: pollen), Hans (1973: chromosomes), Levin (1986: leaves), Mennega (1987: wood anatomy), Tokuoka and Tobe (2001: ovules and seeds), Westra and Koek-Noorman (2004: wood end-grain),Le&oacute;n Enriquez et al. (2008: architectural variation in the family), and Zhang et al. (2012: floral morphology of <i>Phyllanthus</i>. For pollen, see Webster and Carpenter (2008) and Chen et al. (2009, both <i>Phyllanthus</i>, and Sagun and van der Ham (2003: pollen morphology of Flueggeinae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Phyllanthaceae include most of the old Euphorbiaceae-Phyllanthoideae, minus <i>Drypetes</i> and relatives, for which see Putranjivaceae. For phylogenetic relationships, see Wurdack et al. (2004: morphology also discussed, the odd genus <i>Croizatia</i> included), and Samuel et al. (2005: two gene analysis). Kathriarachchi et al. (2005: five-genes; see also Hoffmann et al. 2006) divide the family into two main clades, one largely with fasciculate inflorescences (it includes <i>Lingelsheimia</i>, sometimes previously associated with Putranjivaceae, and <i>Dicoelia</i>, ditto with Pandaceae), the Phyllanthoideae above, and the other (including Hymenocardieae) tanniniferous, the Antidesmatoideae above. For the phylogeny of <i>Phyllanthus</i>, see (Kathriarachchi et al. 2006; Pruesapan et al. 2008), for that of Poranthereae, see Voronstova et al. (2007).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Govaerts et al. (2000: as Euphorbiaceae) provide a checklist and bibliography, but this is now dated - e.g. see Vorontsova and Hoffmann (2008) for genera in Phyllanthoideae-Poranthereae, while Hoffmann et al. (2006) provide the phylogenetic classification followed here.</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> The limits of <i>Cleistanthus</i> will have to be adjusted, and most species will need a new name (Li et al. 2009), while the large genus <i>Phyllanthus</i>
is paraphyletic, and its limits should probably be broadened to include <i>Glochidion</i> (some 300 species), <i>Breynia</i>, <i>Sauropus</i> (70 spp.), etc. (Kathriarachchi et al. 2006; Lorence &amp; Wagner 2011 - but c.f. Pruesapan et al. 2008). For a monograph of <i>Baccaurea</i> and relatives, see Haegens (2000), and of <i>Aporosa</i>, see Schot (2004).</p>

<ul><li>Picrodendraceae are vegetatively rather heterogeneous, although they often have opposite, toothed and stipulate leaves with pinnate venation and deciduous glands capping their teeth. The capsules are like those of Euphorbiaceae and the seeds may be carunculate.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> The New World <i>Piranhea</i> may dominate flooded forests (Connell &amp; Lowman 1989).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Seed Dispersal.</u> Myrmecochory occurs in the majority of the species of the family (Lengyel et al. 2009, 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The family is poorly known. <i>Picrodendron</i> may have a perianth of two whorls (Hakki 1985), or perhaps it is modified quincuncial.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some information is taken from van Welzen &amp; Forster (2010: general), Hayden
(1977, 1994: wood anatomy), Levin and Simpson (1994: pollen), Huber (1991) and Tokuoka and Tobe (1999: seed anatomy), Wurdack et al. (2004: some morphology), Westra and Koek-Noorman (2004: wood end-grain), and Merino Sutter et al. (2006: morphology of carpellate flowers).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For the taxa included in this
family, see Euphorbiaceae-Oldfieldioideae (Webster 1994b). <i>Paradrypetes</i> is probably to be
included in Rhizophoraceae, although it is like <i>Podocalyx</i> in particular in wood anatomy and pollen morphology (Levin 1992). <i>Croizatia</i> (see Levin 1992) is also odd, with 5 petals,
an extrastaminal disc and style with distinct branches, and it lacks the distinctive pollen of the family; it is here placed in Phyllanthaceae (confirmed by molecular data: see Wurdack et al. 2004; Wurdack 2008).
Stuppy (1996) noted that both <i>Picrodendron</i> and <i>Oldfieldia</i> were
rather different from other taxa included in his Oldfieldioideae, and he
compared the latter  with Meliaceae because of similarity in seed characters. However, both genera are firmly in Picrodendraceae-Picrodendreae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Ixonanthaceae have been associated with a variety of families, although Van Hooren and Nooteboom (1988) noted that they had indeed often been assoociated with Linaceae. Thus Robson and Airy Shaw (1962) thought that the "spiral convolution of the filaments and style" of <i>Cyrillopsis</i> (Ixonanthaceae)
was a point of similarity between this genus and Irvingiaceae. However, some species of <i>Ochthocosmus</i> also have flowers very similar to those
of <i>Cyrillopsis</i>, with the thin calyx reflexed after anthesis (<i>Phyllocosmus</i>,
<i>Ixonanthes</i>), while other species of <i>Ochthocosmus</i> have persistent,
erect, almost scarious-looking sepals, as is common in Linaceae. </p>

<p>Synonymy: <b>Hugoniaceae</b> Arnott</p>

<ul><li>The leaf may have longitudinal lines on the abaxial surface, the caducous petals are contorted and often
yellow, and the fruits are often septicidal and have only a few seeds. I find Linaceae difficult to
recognize...</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Linaceae may have diverged from other Malpighiales in the Cretaceous-Albian 111-100 m.y.a. (Davis et al. 2005a), while McDill and Simspon (2011, q.v. for more details, Irvingiaceae taken as closest to Linaceae) suggest that crown group divergence is early Caenozoic (range 82-43 m.y.), Linoideae beginning to diversify in the Eocene and Hugonioideae in the Oligocene-Miocene.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> Heterostylous flowers are scattered in Linoideae, and tristyly is reported from at least some Hugonioideae (Meeus et al. 2011), but whether heterostyly is an apomorphy for Linaceae is unclear; breeding systems have certainly been labile (Thompson et al. 1996; McDill et al. 2008, 2009). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Economic Importance.</b> Seeds of flax (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i>) have been used for oil, etc., for about 10,000 years (Vaisey-Genser &amp; Morris 2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Ellagic acid is not reported from
Linoideae, but members of this subfamily are largely herbaceous. Flat vernation is reported from <i>Linum narbonense</i> by Cullen (1978),
other taxa may be conduplicate. Bracts and bracteoles have a single vascular trace. <i>Tirpitzia bilocularis</i> has a corolla tube over 2 cm long. The "staminodes" may lack any vascularization (Al-Nowaihi &amp; Khalifa 1973). Tobe and Raven (2011) suggest that the inner integument is multiplicative. In Hugonioideae, only half of the ovules may develop and produce seeds. Guinard (1893) drew the ovules of <i>Linum</i> as having a single parietal layer of cells; at the base of the embryo sac there was a persistent narrow column of cells.  Note that septicidal dehiscence, presumably liberating pyrenes, may occur in this subfamily (Spichiger et al. 2002).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For information on the family and
its possible segregates see Hegnauer (1966, 1989: chemistry), Boesewinkel (1980), L. L. Narayana (1970) and Narayana and Rao (1966, 1969, 1978a), all embryology, floral anatomy, etc., Robertson (1971: Linoideae), van Hooren and
Nooteboom (1984, 1988a, b: general), van Welzen and Baas (1984: anatomy), Jardim (1999: New World Hugonioideae), Schmidt et al. (2010: lignans, in most <i>Linum</i> alone), and Schewe et al. (2011: floral development in <i>Linum</i>.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> McDill et al. (2009: focus on Linoideae) oulined phylogenetic relationships in the family; Linoideae may be monophyletic, but support is from posterior probabilities only; the status of Hugonioideae is unclear. However, in the more extended sudy of McDill and Simpson (2011) Linoideae are well supported, Hugonioideae monophyletic, but still lacking strong support,</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> If the topology suggested by McDill and Simpson (2011) is maintained in future studies, nomenclatural adjustments will be needed - perhaps best to expand <i>Linum</i>?</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous relationships.</b> For an early detailed discussion on relationships of Linaceae, then thought to be a "central" family, see Hallier (1923). Linaceae are weakly associated with Picrodendraceae in Chase et al. (2002a), and with Irvingiaceae in Tokuoka and Tobe (2006). Linaceae have been linked with Erythroxylaceae and Humiriaceae, and thence to Geraniales (Narayana &amp; Rao 1978b), or the three families together are placed in Linales (Cronquist 1981).</p></p>
