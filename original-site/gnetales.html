Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013) suggested an age of 140-120 m.y., Won and Renner (2006)  ages of (196-)159(-132) m.y., Ickert-Bond et al. (2010: 95% h.p.d.) ages of (192.3-)166.6(-90.6) m.y. and Laenen et al. (2014) an age of around 261.8 m. years.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> <i>Ephedra</i> and <i>Welwitschia</i> had diverged by 110 m.y. ago or more, the welwitschioid seedling, <i>Cratonia</i>, from Brazil, being of this vintage (Rydin et al. 2003), while pollen and seeds attributed to a welwitschioid plant are known from the Lower Cretaceous both in Portugal and eastern North America (Friis et al. 2014). For a probable Gnetalean fossil from the Permian, some 250-270 m.y.a., see Wang (2004). Both <i>Ephedra</i> and <i>Welwitschia</i> have distinctive ridged pollen that has a fossil record of <font face="Symbol">&#179;</font>250 m.y., being common from the Late Triassic onwards. Dilcher et al. (2005) noted that Gnetalean-like (striate/ribbed) pollen was common in both N. and S. Hemispheres; in the former, records are from the Upper Triassic onwards, in the latter, especially in the early Cretaceous from the northern half of South America. The pollen found by Wang (2004) associated with his fossil, <i>Palaeognetaleana auspicia</i>, is of this general kind.  However, that fossil was radiospermic and had two complete integuments, a possible third integument being represented by scales, and the arrangement of parts in the cone was spiral, so what it represents is unclear.  Crane (1996) summarized the fossil history of Gnetales (see Won &amp; Renner 2006; Rydin &amp; Friis 2010 for additional references; Herendeen et al. 2017 for some pre-Cretaceous supposedly angiosperm fossils that are better placed in this general area).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Seeds of Ephedraceae are similar to those of Erdmanithecales (Rydin et al. 2006);  for more detail see <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#StemGroupEvolution">stem-group angiosperms</a> and

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Note:</b>  <b>Boldface</b> denotes possible apomorphies, (....) denotes a feature common in the clade, exact status uncertain, [....] includes explanatory material. Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Gnetales s.l., i.e., stem-group Gnetales and including the fossil groups above, show considerably more variation than perhaps might have been expected given the small size of the clade. In the Cretaceous in particular the diversity of Gnetales and the possibly related Bennettitales and Erdtmanithecale (all have an elongated micropyle, etc. - see Friis et al. 2011: chapter 5 and the <a href="Cycadales.html#EpGnWe" target="home">Cycadales</a> page), and several genera of Gnetalean affinity have been described from the Brazilian Crato formation, some 115-112 m.y.o. (L&ouml;we et al. 2013 and references). Horizontally-ridged (ephedroid) pollen was notably common 125-85 m.y.a. (Barremian-Santonian) in lower latitudes between 30<sup> N and S (northern Gondwana), angiosperms and Gnetales perhaps preferring similar habitats (Crane &amp; Lidgard 1989, 1990; see also Friis et al. 2014). For a discussion of the fossil record, see Ickert-Bond and Renner (2016: not pollen).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Additional variation such as pollen size (e.g.  Ickert-Bond &amp; Renner 2016) can be optimized on the tree.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Here xylans are more common than glucomannans, as in flowering plants. They have glucoronosyl units every 6 or 8 or so xylosyl residues, and they are acetylated every other xylosyl residue, but there are no &alpha;-arabinosyl units. Overall, they are more similar to angiosperms, perhaps more particularly to magnoliids than to eudicots, less similar to  other gymnosperms, which are glucomannan-rich (Busse-Wicher et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Ovules in all three extant genera - in <i>Ephedra</i>, including the sterile ovules found in male inflorescences in <i>E. foemina</i>, sister to the rest of the genus, many <i>Gnetum</i>, and <i>Welwitschia</i> (see J&ouml;rgensen &amp; Rydin 2015 for homolies) - secrete  pollination droplets, and these are sometimes suggested to be notably sucrose-rich (Ziegler et al. 1959; Nepi et al. 2009: c.f. pollination droplet of <i>Welwitschia</i>, fructose-rich). Plants are visited by diptera, lepidoptera (moths), and other pollinators (see Kato &amp; Inoue 1994; Labandeira 2005; Bolinder et al. 2015; Rydin &amp; Bolinder 2015). Insect pollination may well be the ancestral condition of the whole clade, while wind pollination (especially common in <i>Ephedra</i>) is derived (Bolinder et al. 2015; J&ouml;rgensen &amp; Rydin 2015; Rydin &amp; Bolinder 2015; Bolinder et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For details of the time from pollination to fertilization, short for a gymnosperm, see Williams (2008 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> The nuclear genome is small, C values being 1.4-3.5 picograms (Leitch et al. 2001, 2005). The extensive polyploidy in <i>Ephedra</i> is unusual among conifers (Scott et al. 2016). Evidence for the whole genome duplication of seed plants is unclear (Z. Li et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> All three genera also have very small chloroplast genomes, <i>Welwitschia</i> rather less so than the others, and it has been suggested that  this is because they grow in resource-poor environments, but genome size in <i>Pinus</i>, for example, may not be much bigger (see also C.-S. Wu et al. 2007, 2009 and references: other seed plants growing in similar environments?). Up to 18 genes have been lost from the chloroplast (McCoy et al. 2008; C.-S. Wu et al. 2009; Jansen &amp; Ruhlman 2012 and references). Gnetales have a high substitution rates in their chloroplast genomes, <i>dN</i>/<i>dS</i> being lower than in other gymnosperms (B. Wang et al. 2015). Variation in the <i>nad</i>1 intron 2 needs clarification; it is absent in <i>Welwitschia</i>, present in <i>Gnetum</i>, and what is going on in <i>Ephedra</i> is not entirely clear (Gugerli et al. 2001).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Morphology, Anatomy, etc.</b> Although vessels in <i>Gnetum</i>, for example, are commonly described as being derived from circular pits, this has been questioned (e.g. Rodin 1969; Muhammad &amp; Sattler 1982). Rodin (1969) suggested that Gnetales lack pits with a margo-torus construction, they are clearly shown for <i>Ephedra</i>, but not <i>Gnetum</i>, by Eicke (1957). For gelatinous fibres (g-fibres), see Montes et al. (2012); in <i>Ephedra</i>, at least, their presence had nothing to do with bending and they are not associated with wood tissues, so they are not reaction/tension wood (c.f. angiosperms; c.f. Tomlinson et al. 2014). When stems of <i>Gnetum</i> are bent, more tissue develops on the adaxial side, but without reaction wood fibres (Shirai et al. 2015: microfibril angle may be important). There are nodal girdles of tissue very like transfusion tissue, at least in <i>Ephedra</i> (Beck et al. 1982). For the numbers of veins entering the leaves, see  Rydin and Friis (2010). Boyce and Knoll (2002), Nardmann and Werr (2013), and others discuss leaf development; the scale leaves in some species of <i>Ephedra</i> are reductions.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Interpretations of the parts of both the microsporangium- and megasporangium-bearing structures differ substantially (e.g. Gifford &amp; Foster 1989; Hufford 1997a; Mundry &amp; St&uuml;tzel 2004). In microsporangiate plants of all three extant genera both stamens and non-functional ovules (although pollination droplets may still be produced) are closely associated, although this perhaps least marked in <i>Ephedra</i> (see also Flores-Renter&iacute;a et al. 2011), and the microsporangiate cones can be interpreted as being compound (Mundry &amp; St&uuml;tzel 2004), rather like the megasporangiate cones of Pinales. The plants themselves are functionally dioecious. For a careful discussion about pollen grain morphology, and the  counter-intuitive orientation of the pollen grains of <i>Ephedra</i> and <i>Welwitschia</i>, see El-Ghazaly et al. (1997). <i>Gnetum ula</i> is reported as having two sperm cells (Singh 1978). Plastid transmission appears to be maternal, at least in <i>Ephedra distachya</i> (Moussel 1978). The megaspore membrane is thin, but is definitely present (Doyle 2006). For discussion about seedling morphology, particularly about the distribution of the "feeder" and the haustorial (or otherwise) nature of the cotyledon, see Sokoloff et al. (2015b). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Martens (1971) provides an extensive treatment of the whole group (see also Gifford &amp; Foster 1989), and for a very useful survey of Gnetales, see Ickert-Bond and Renner (2016). For the morphology of Gnetales in the context of that of fossil gymnosperms, see e.g. Doyle and Donoghue (1986a, b) and especially  Doyle (2006, 2008b, and references), for mycorrhizae, see Jacobson et al. (1993),  for wood anatomy, Carlquist (1997, 2012b), and for pollen, see Osborn (2000: comparison with gymnospermous "anthophytes"), Yao et al. (2004: pollen of Gnetales compared with that of <i>Nymphaea colorata</i>), Rydin and Friis (2005: pollen germination) and Tekleva and Krassilov (2009) and articles in <i>Grana</i> 55(1). 2016, for pollen morphology, including that of fossils. Friedman (1992), Carmichael and Friedman (1996) and Friedman and Carmichael (1997, and references) discuss double fertilization and Friedman (2015) that and much more, Takaso (1985 and references) described integument morphology, Endress (1997) details of megasporangiate structures,  Hufford (1997a) microsporangium arrangement and Mathews and Tremonte (2012) greening of seedlings in the dark.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For general discussion on the relationships of Gnetales, see also <a href="Cycadales.html#extseedplantsrels" target="home">above</a>; this includes discussion of the anthophyte hypothesis, Gnetales sister to angiosperms, and other hypotheses of gnetalean relationships. As mentioned there, a position of <i>Gnetum</i>, etc., in or near Pinales is becoming increasingly credible, although both Gnetales and the individual families are often on very long branches (e.g. Ickert-Bond &amp; Renner 2016), and Rydin et al. (2002) strongly questioned the possibility of any paraphyly of Pinales.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A [Gnetales + Pinales] clade - the <u>Gnetifer hypothesis</u> - has frequently been recovered (e.g. Samigullin et al. 1999: not all analyses; Antonov et al. 2000; Sanderson et al. 2000; Chaw et al. 2000; Gugerli et al. 2001: rather strong support; de la Torre et al. 2006: much hidden support, but not from the chloroplast partition; Wu et al. 2007; Rydin &amp; Korall 2009: Bayesian analysis; Ran et al. 2010: the mitochondrial <i>rps</i>3 gene; Rai &amp; Graham 2010: support not very strong; C.-S. Wu et al. 2013: some analyses; Magall&oacute;n et al. 2013; Rothfels et al. 2015b; Ickert-Bond &amp; Renner 2016), and it is the preferred topology in Englund et al. (2011) and  Groth et al. (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Gnetales may even be placed within Pinales, in particular being sister to Pinaceae; this is the <u>Gnepine hypothesis</u> (e. g. Chaw et al. 2000; Bowe et al. 2000; Gugerli et al. 2001; Hajibabaei 2003; Burleigh &amp; Mathews 2004, 2007c: supermatrix analyses; Hajibabaei et al. 2006: genes from all three compartments, sampling?; Qiu et al. 2007; Graham &amp; Iles 2009; Finet et al. 2010: quite strong support; Soltis et al. 2011; Shen et al. 2017; evaluation of support). This topology was also found by Zhong et al. (2011, see also 2010; also C.-S. Wu et al. 2011b, 2014) when the most variable sites in concatenated alignments were removed, so reducing the LBA/heterotachy problem, and by the concatenation-based transcriptome analyses of Wickett et al (2014). Analyses of nuclear data tend to support this hypothesis.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Gnetales have also been found to be sister to Cupressaceae, the <u>Gnecup hypothesis</u>, as in an analysis of an amino acid matrix derived from chloroplast genomes (Zhong et al. 2010; see also Ruhfel et al. 2014); both quickly-evolving proteins and also proteins in which there appeared to be much parallel evolution in <i>Cryptomeria</i> and the branch leading to all Gnetales were removed. If they were not removed, a clade [<i>Cryptomeria</i> + Gnetales] was obtained (Zhong et al. 2010; see also Moore et al. 2011; C.-S. Wu et al. 2013). Similarly, an analysis of variation in 83 plastid genes strongly suggested a grouping [Pinaceae [Gnetales + other Pinales]], although other relationships could not be entirely rejected (Chumley et al. 2008; see also Ruhfel et al. 2014). Finally, Raubeson et al. (2006) found that <i>Welwitschia</i> grouped with <i>Podocarpus</i>, but this may be due to rate heterogeneity.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Xi et al. (2013b), using much nuclear and plastid data, although they included only ten gymnosperms, found a poorly to moderately supported [<i>Gnetum</i> + Pinaceae] clade in analyses of nuclear genes only. In analyses of chloroplast data a relationship with Cupressaceae was preferred (see also Davis et al. 2014a for the influence of different genomes); in both cases the alternative topology was rejected  with a <i>p</i>-value of 0.001. This suggested to Xi et al. (2013b) that the two genomes of <i>Gnetum</i> had different histories. See also X.-Q. Wang and Ran (2014) for discussion; they noted that analyses of different classes of genes resulted in different topologies.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Thus despite a number of unresolved issues, a position somewhere around Pinales seems most likely  for Gnetales. There are some specific points of genomic similarity between <i>Gnetum</i>, etc., and some or all Pinales. Some Pinaceae have lost a number of the chloroplast genes that are missing in Gnetales (Wu et al. 2009). All eleven NADH dehydrogenase genes in the chloroplast of <i>Pinus thunbergii</i> are absent - or are present, but as pseudogenes (Wakasugi et al. 1994); other work suggests that these genes are absent in all Gnetales and Pinales alone  (Braukmann et al. 2009, also 2010; Mart&iacute;n &amp; Sabater 2010; Wicke et al. 2011). The <i>rps</i>16 gene in Gnetales and Pinaceae is commonly lost (Wu et al. 2007, 2009). All Pinales sampled have but a single copy of the chloroplast inverted repeat (Strauss et al. 1988; Tsudzuki et al. 1992); nearly all other seed plants have two copies (Raubeson &amp; Jansen 1992; Lackey &amp; Raubeson 2008), and this may be marked by micromorphological changes in the genome. Interestingly, one end of the inverted repeat of <i>Welwitschia</i> has expanded (<i>Welwitschia</i> is derived within Gnetales) with duplication of <i>trn</i>I-CAU and partial duplication of <i>pscb</i>A gene region at the end of the Large Single Copy region, and these match those of the remnant inverted repeat known from <i>Pinus</i> and other Pinaceae, but not other members of Pinales (Margheim et al. 2006; McCoy et al. 2006, 2008: details of relationship depend on methods of analysis; see also Braukmann et al. 2009; Hirao et al. 2009).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> There are also some morphological similarities between Pinales and Gnetales, and within the former, perhaps particularly with Pinaceae. The binucleate sperm cells, basic proembryo structure, development of polyembryony, etc., of <i>Ephedra</i> agree with Pinales in general and perhaps Pinaceae in particular. Some <i>Pinus</i> species have mesogenous stomata in which the subsidiary cells are produced from the same initial that gives rise to the guard cells (Gifford &amp; Foster 1989; see also Mundry &amp; St&uuml;tzel 2004), as in Gnetales. Strobili with both micro- and megasporangia are common as abnormalities in Pinales (Chamberlain 1935; Rudall et al. 2011a) and occur normally in <i>Gnetum</i>. However, wherever Gnetales  are placed, they will have numerous apomorphies. Thus although nearly all Pinales have megasporangiate strobili with spirally-arranged ovuliferous scales or modifications of them, Gnetales have decussating bracts (Magall&oacute;n &amp; Sanderson 2002); loss of the ovuliferous scale, etc., might also be apomorphies (Finet et al. 2010).  </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">However, given the uncertainty in our knowledge of the relationships between the major seed-plant clades, direct links are provided to <a href="cycadales.html#Cycadales" target="home">Cycadales</a>, <a href="ginkgoales.html#Ginkgoales" target="home">Ginkgoales</a>, <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#StemGroupEvolution" target="home">flowering plants</a>, and <a href="conifers.html#Conifers" target="home">Pinales</a> here. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Gnetales relationships are [<i>Ephedra</i> [<i>Gnetum</i> + <i>Welwitschia</i>]] (e.g. Price 1996).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b>  If the evidence continues to point to a [Pinaceae + Gnetales] clade, Gnetales will disappear - or something else will happen.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Ickert-Bond et al. (2009; see also Rydin &amp; Ickert-Bond 2010; Rydin et al. 2010) estimate that divergence with the genus occurred quite recently, only (73.5-)30.4(-20.55) m.y.a. (see also  Huang &amp; Price 2003: 32-8 m.y.), but c.f. the fossil record below. The estimate in Laenen et al. (2014) is ca 221.8 m.y.a.,  (130-)120(-110) m.y. is another estimate of its crown-group age (Rydin &amp; Hoorn 2016), and around the later Palaeocene, somewhat under 60 m.y.a., is another suggestion (Loera et al. 2015). Another group where there is much sorting out to do.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A variety of fossils assignable to Ephedraceae are known from the lower Cretaceous in China (Zhou et al. 2003; Y. Yang &amp; Ferguson 2015 and references). Rothwell and Stockey (2009) report a fossil from the Lower Cretaceous that has purportedly ancestral characters for <i>Ephedra</i> - two ovules together, and absence of a tubular micropyle and of a structure surrounding the ovule (seed envelope above), but this is unlikely to be assignable to crown group Gnetales (other <i>Ephedra</i> from this period may have three ovules - Yang &amp; Wang 2013). The distinctive pollen of <i>Ephedra</i> has been found inside fossil seeds that are morphologically also <i>Ephedra</i> in late Aptian to Early Albian (early Cretaceous) deposits from Portugal, suggesting that diversification in the genus occurred some 127-110 m.y.a. (Rydin et al. 2004). Indeed, Early Cretaceous fossils of <i>Ephedra</i> have a "modern" morphology, <i>E. paleorhytidosperma</i> having distinctive seeds very like those of the extant <i>E. rhytidosperma</i> (Yang et al. 2005), although Doyle (2016) suggest that early fossil seeds cannot be assigned to crown <i>Ephedra</i>. The dating situation is further confused because derived pollen of <i>Ephedra</i>, i.e. with laterally-branched pseudosulci, is known from around 95 m.y.a in the Cretaceous-Raritan (Bolinder et al. 2015b).</p>

<ul><li>Ephedraceae are rather small, shrubby, much-branched, xeromorphic plants that may be readily recognised by their green, photosynthetic stems, often reduced opposite leaves and small cones borne along the shoots. </ul>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  The history of <i>Ephedra</i> has a number of surprises.  Ephedroid pollen was notably common 125-85 m.y.a. in northern Gondwana, and derived pollen morphologies (pollen with pseudosulci) are known from the Late Cretaceous (Crane &amp; Lidgard 1980; see also Friis et al. 2014; Bolinder et al. 2016), and <i>Ephedra</i> (or ephedroid) seeds with a variety of morphologies are known from both South America and East Asia, and include fleshy fruits in deposits 125-120 m.y.o. (Y. Yang &amp; Wang 2013). The genus seems to have gone into a severe decline at the end of the Cretaceous, and subsequent diversification in the Palaeogene may be linked to the adoption of wind pollination (Bolinder et al. 2012, 2016). How far different seed types are dispersed may also affect diversification (Loera et al. 2015: see also diversification times, evolution of niche breadth, etc., in South American taxa). Extant taxa show little genetic divergence and most relationships have little support (Rydin et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Ephedra</i> perhaps moved from the Old to the New World in the Oligocene (41.5-)29.6(-8.8) m.y.a. and to South America in the Miocene (Ickert-Bond et al. 2009).  There has been parallel evolution in micromorphological details of the seed envelope (Ickert-Bond &amp; Rydin 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For allopolyploidy and speciation in <i>Ephedra</i>, see H. Wu et al. (2016), also discussion in Ickert-Bond and Renner (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Pollination in extant species is mostly by wind (Niklas 2015). However, <i>Ephedra foemina</i> is pollinated by insects and i.a. has pollen with a faster settling velocity than that of wind-pollinated taxa, while some fossil "ephedroid" pollen also has characteristics of insect pollination with a thick tectum and dense infratectal layer (Bolinder et al. 2015a; c.f. Hall &amp; Walter 2011 in part). Pollination in <i>E. foemina</i> is probably by nocturnal moths, pollen being released around the time of the full moon, and as in other species, both the sterile ovules in male strobili and the ovules in female strobili produce pollination droplets (Rydin &amp; Bolinder 2015). Pollination droplets are always rich in sucrose, and in wind-pollinated taxa  they aid in pollen tube formation and development (von Aderkas et al. 2014). There are protein and peptide fragments (= degradome) in the pollination drops, probably formed as cells break down as the pollen chamber develops (von Aderkas et al. 2014), although some proteins may have defensive functions, etc. (c.f. Wagner et al. 2007).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Because the pollen exine of <i>Ephedra</i> is shed on germination (shed exines can be seen in some fossils - Bolinder et al. 2015b), the male gametophyte is naked. El Ghazaly et al. (1998) qualify the apparent absence of germination apertures. Fertilization occurs 10-15 hours after pollination (Williams 2012b and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">As the seeds ripen, the bracts surrounding the ovule may become fleshy and brightly coloured, or they may dry, become membranous, enclosing winged seeds, or it the seeds may be faintly nondescript, being dispersed by scatter-hoarding rodents (Hollander &amp; Vander Wall 2009; Loera et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> There has been a great increase in the rate of synonymous substitutions in the mitochondrial genome, and chloroplast and nuclear sequences are also divergent compared with those of other seed plants (Mower et al. 2007 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The nuclear genome is very variable in size, and can be huge (see above: Ickert-Bond et al. 2014b, 2015a). This is connected with extensive variability in chromosome numbers, unusual for gymnosperms, in turn linked with polyploidy, but there is little subsequent genome downsizing, unlike  the common situation in angiosperms (Ickert-Bond et al. 2015a; see also Scott et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> 
Species of <i>Ephedra</i> are pharmacologically very active and contain a number of distinctive secondary metabolites (Caveney et al. 2001).  (</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Biswas and Johri (1997) mention the "deep origin of the periderm", a position that should be confirmed.  Early Cretaceous fossils are described as having a dichasial branching pattern and linear leaves with two parallel veins (Y. Yang &amp; Wang 2013). For leaf and nodal anatomy of extant species of <i>Ephedra</i> with well developed leaves, i.e. long and linear, see D&ouml;rken (2014) and Deshpande and Keswani (1963);  the xylem of the two vascular bundles faces each other, and the leaf has been ventralised.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is only a single integument. The seed envelope surrounding the ovule proper is first apparent as an arcuate structure adaxial to the ovule, but it is thought to represent connate foliar structures; it is both dermal and subdermal in origin, compared with the dermal origin of the integument (Takaso 1985; Rydin et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For some general information, see Rydin et al. (2004) and the <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.conifers.org/ep/index.htm',600,500)">Gymnosperm Database</a>, and for nodal anatomy, see Marsden and Steeves (1955) and Singh and Maheshwari (1962).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> There is little strong phylogenetic structure along the backbone of a 7 plastid gene-2 compartment analysis of extant species of <i>Ephedra</i>, indeed, there is rather little molecular divergence within the genus (Rydin &amp; Korall 2009; Rydin et al. 2010). Mediterranean species may form a grade at the base of the tree, and in the monophyletic New World clade, a South American clade is embedded in a paraphyletic North American group, however, in some analyses the Mediterranean species form a clade (e.g. Rydin &amp; Korall 2009; Ickert-Bond &amp; Renner 2016 and refences). The insect-pollinated <i>Ephedra foeminea</i> (see above) may be sister to the rest of the genus.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Clasification.</b> For a classification of Ephedraceae, including fossil members, see Y. Yang (2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Ickert-Bond et al. (2010) suggest ages of (127-)111.3(-87.2) m.y. for divergence within this clade, Won and Renner (2006)  ages of (175-)138(-112) m. years. Rather younger at around 87.7 m.y. is the age in Tank et al. (2015: Table S2), ca 94.4 m.y. in Laenen et al. (2014)  and around 81.9 m.y. in Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013); on the other hand, the age in Magall&oacute;n et al. (2015: note topology) was around 239 m.y. ago. </p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Siphonospermum</i>, a fossil from the  Lower Cretaceous from Northeast China, may be assignable to this part of the tree (Rydin &amp; Friis 2010). See below for fossils placed in Welwitschiaceae which, if correctly identified, would rule out the younger ages above. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For cyclopropenoid acids, similar to those in Malvales, see Aitzetm&uuml;ller and Vosmann (1998). Rodin (1968) suggested that the reticulate venation of <i>Gnetum</i>, at least, was a modified dichotomizing system.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Crown-group Gnetaceae are (77-)44-26(-13) m.y.o., or using a strict clock, as little as 6 m.y. (Won and Renner 2006);  (98-)81(-64) m.y. is the age suggested by C. Hou et al. (2015).</p>

<ul><li>Gnetaceae are woody, evergreen plants with opposite, angiosperm-like leaves whose bases surround the stem; axillary to the leaves are strobili, often branched. </ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For biogeographical relationships in the genus, basically a story of post-Eocene diversification and dispersal, see Renner (2005b) and Won and Renner (2006). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Entomophily has been reported from Malesian species of <i>Gnetum</i> (e.g. Kato &amp; Inoue 1994). J&ouml;rgensen and Rydin (2015) float the possibility that African species of <i>Gnetum</i>, which lack sterile ovules in the male cones and so have no obvious attractants for insects there, may be wind pollinated. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Brundrett (2008, seen viii.2012) summarizes information on the mycorrhizal status of members of Gnetales as a whole.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Horizontal gene transfer of the mitochondrial <i>nad</i>1 intron 2 from flowering plants (an asterid) to an Asian clade of <i>Gnetum</i> seems to have occurred within the last 5 m.y. (Won &amp; Renner 2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Gnetum gnemon</i> contains fair amounts of silica (Trembath-Reichert et el. 2015). Not surprisingly, the wood of the lianoid taxa is distinctive, with serial cambia being formed. The reaction wood in <i>Gnetum</i> consists of gelatinous extra-xylary (reaction) fibres in the adaxial position (Tomlinson 2001b, 2003; see also H&ouml;ster &amp; Liese 1966); it is not typical tension wood. See Martens (1971) for the vascularization of the leaves; pairs of vascular bundles leave the central stele in close proximity.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is vascular tissue in the two outer coverings of the ovule, but vascular bundles barely enter the base of the integument. The outer covering is definitely bilobed early in development, the lobes alternating with bracts, but the middle covering is only weakly bilobed (Takaso &amp; Bouman 1986). Although some gametophyte development occurs after fertilization, the ovule increases appreciably in size between pollination and fertilization (Leslie &amp; Boyce 2012). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see the <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.conifers.org/gn/index.htm',600,500)">Gymnosperm Database</a>, for mycorrhizae, see Onguene and Kuyper (2001), for pollen, see Gillespie and Nowicke (1994) and Tekleva (2015), for reproductive morphology and development, see Sanwal (1962), and for embryology, see Vasil (1959).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Relationships within <i>Gnetum</i> are strongly correlated with geography, i.e. [South America [Africa + S.E. Asia-Malesia]] (Won &amp; Renner 2006), somewhat elaborated as [South America [Africa [S. Asia - 2 arborescent spp. + The Rest]]], and diversification here is much older than in <i>Ephedra</i> (C. Hou et al. 2015).</p>

<ul><li>Welwitschiaceae can immediately be recognised by the two, long leaves that ensheath the stem; these become curled and are dead and torn at the apices. The plant has no trunk as such, but the stem becomes quite massive. </ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  <i>Cratonia cotyledon</i> is a fossil seedling with distinctive cotyledon vasculature very like that of the leaves of <i>Welwitschia</i>, the secondary veins leaving from the primary veins fuse to form an inverted "Y" (Rydin et al. 2003).  <i>Cratonia</i> was found in N.E. Brazil and is late Aptian or early Albian in age, perhaps 114-112 m.y. old; other fossils of welwitschiaceous or more generally gnetalean affinity have been found in the same area (Dilcher et al. 2005; L&ouml;we et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Welwitschia mirabilis</i> grows in the Namib desert close to the ocean; although there is little rain, fogs are frequent - but not where <i>Welwitschia</i> grows (von Willert 1985); for aspects of vascular anatomy that may be associated with this habitat, see Carlquist (2012b). <i>Welwitschia</i> is a CAM plant, but at very low levels, and malic/citric acids tend to concentrate towards the apex of the leaf, perhaps enhancing water flow at night (von Willert et al. 2005).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Plants can live for hundreds of years old, the two persistent leaves growing at the base and fraying at the apex.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Pollination appears to be by diptera (Wetschnig &amp; Depisch 1999; Bolinder et al. 2015 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u>  The prolonged basal growth of the leaves involves the expression of <i>KNOX1</i> genes, so maintaining an undifferentiated state in the leaves (Pham &amp; Sinha 2003).

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Z. Li (2015; see also Cui et al. 2006) suggests that the genome of <i>Welwitschia</i> has been duplicated, as is perhaps suggested by its high chromosome numbers. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The chloroplast genome of <i>Welwitschia mirabilis</i> is the  smallest plastid genome of all non-parasitic land plants that have inverted repeats (McCoy et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The large mitochondrial genome of <i>Welwitschia</i> has lost genes and introns and is otherwise remarkable (W. Guo et al. 2016a, see also 2016b), however, practically nothing is known about the mitochondrial genome of other Gnetales.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Because of the abundant, branched sclereids in the plant, "One might as well try to cut sections of a thick Scotch plaid blanket as to try and cut a stem of <i>Welwitschia</i> without imbedding." (Chamberlain 1935: pp. 388-389).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Kaplan (1997, vol. 1:6) described the seedling as having a haustorial collet (collar). Serial axillary buds are added throughout the course of the long life of the plant, the youngest buds being in the centre of the axil - a branch-like organization? See Martens (1971) for the vascularisation of the bracts of the megasporangia and the complex organisation of the axis of the megasporangiate strobilus.</p>
