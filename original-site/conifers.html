 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Clarke et al. (2011: other ages) suggested a crown age for Pinales of (286-)252(-212) m.y., Magall&oacute;n et al.

(2015: Table S2) are also broadly comparable. Leslie et al. (2012) suggested an age of around 350-275 m.y.a., but Zhou et al. (2014) and Magall&oacute;n et al. (2015) suggested appreciably younger ages of (187.3-)161.4(-147) and ca 127 m.y.a. respectively; see also P. Soltis et al. (2002).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Note:</b>  <b>Boldface</b> denotes possible apomorphies, (....) denotes a feature common in the clade, exact status uncertain, [....] includes explanatory material. Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).  In particular, if Gnetales are to be included here, depending on where they end up, apomorphies could change considerably. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution</b>. <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> There are no known synapomorphies for a clade containing living and fossil conifers (e.g. Rothwell &amp; Serbet 1994). The morphology of extinct conifers and coniferophytes is being re-evaluated as the morphologies of entire organisms are pieced together from what used to be separate form genera; the result is that many of the conventional taxonomic groupings are being radically overhauled (e.g. Rothwell et al. 2005; Hernandez-Castillo et al. 2009; see also below).  As this is done, the extent of the diversity of these fossil plants is becoming clear.  Not only are forked leaves common, but stomatal distribution, etc., may differ dramatically on leaves from the one plant, compound microsporangiate strobili are known (c.f. Gnetales!), as are megasporagiate strobili which do not terminate vegetative growth of the axis on which they occur (e.g. Hernandez-Castillo et al. 2001; Rothwell &amp; Mapes 2001). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The rate of molecular evolution  of conifers is substantially slower than that in woody angiosperms, let alone that of herbaceous angiosperms, although the rate of non-synonymous substitutions is higher, perhaps connected with their large population side, outcrossing and overall low population structure (Buschiazzo et al. 2012; see also Jaramillo-Correa et al. 2016). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Leslie et al. (2012) offer ages for several conifer clades (see below) and evaluate the fossil data critically; their four-gene tree is based on an almost complete sampling of the group. The current distributions of many extant conifer groups is much smaller than and/or very different from their past distributions (for distribution maps of all conifers, see Farjon &amp; Filer 2013). Many conifers have fossil records going back to the Cretaceous; see Manchester (1999) for north temperate distributions), McIver (2001) for fossils of the African <i>Widdringtonia</i> (Cupressaceae) in rocks of Cretaceous age in Alabama. For the early Caenozoic fossil history of what are now East Asian endemics, see Ferguson et al. (1997) and Manchester et al. (2009) - genera in Taxaceae, Pinaceae, Sciadopityaceae and Cupressaceae are included. However, Biffin et al. (2010b) note that some calibration scenarios have crown-group divergence of Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae largely a (mid-Cretaceous to) Caenozoic phenomenon, which would question the attribution of early fossils at least to those families. Indeed, podocarps with broader leaves seem to have diversified considerably in the earlier Caenozoic in the southern hemisphere (Brodribb &amp; Hill 2004; Biffin &amp; Lowe 2011 - see below).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Diversification in most conifer genera is Caenozoic in age, but Leslie et al. (2012) note that most southern hemisphere clades are older than northern clades, and this is particularly true of the southern Cupressaceae-Callitroideae - its mean node age is four times that of the northern Cupressaceae-Cupressoideae. Leslie et al. (2012) aasociated this with the more equable climate in at least parts of the southern hemisphere compared with the major climate swings in the northern hemisphere beginning in the Oligocene. Earlier, during the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum, conifers, perhaps especially Cupressaceae and Podocarpaceae, were replaced by angiosperm-dominated vegetation (Wing &amp; Currano 2013), although now, of course, Pinaceae dominate boreal forests in particular, and southern conifers, too, can be locally very abundant.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Doyle (2009) discussed the evolution of exine morphology; granular exine may be an aopmophy for the order and then lost twice, or alveolar/honeycomb exine may be plesiomorphous, with granular exine gained three times, or the may be some other combination of gains and losses, but always adding up to three steps. Hence, the optimization here is an arbitrary choice! Franceschi et al. (2008) note possible anatomical apomorphies that are associated with defence against herbivorous insects. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Bond (1989), Keeley and Zedler (1998), Brodribb et al. (2012), Augusto et al. (2014) and others have emphasized that after the seedling stage conifers in general can out-compete angiosperms in a number of environments that are low in nutrients, being able to tolerate poor soil and extreme conditions such as drought and cold.  There are at least four major clades involved: Pinaceae, mostly northern, [Araucariaceae + Podocarpaceae], now mostly southern, and two major clades in Cupressaceae that have largely inhabited the northern and southern hemispheres respectively since the Jurassic (Brodribb et al. 2012). Many conifers, but less the [Podocarpaceae + Araucariaceae] clade, tolerate extreme cold, they grow well in high-light environments, and despite lacking vessels their wood shows moderate hydraulic conductance and is resistant to cavitation, etc. (Brodribb et al. 2012; Augusto et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Sperry (2003), Pitterman et al. (2005), Hacke et al. (2005, 2015) and Sperry et al. (2006) compare water transport in tracheids that have the torus:margo pits found in many conifers (including <i>Ginkgo</i>), with that in other kinds of tracheids and in vessels. Pore size in the margo is relatively large facilitating water transport, while the torus provides a valuable safety feature guarding against embolism as it will plug the pit if pushed against one side by pressure from the embolism. Indeed, hydraulic conductance in tracheids with torus:margo pits is somewhat greater than in vessels of similar diameter when expressed on a sapwood area basis, while studies of cavitation in this system suggest that it is not connected with the size of the pores in the margo, but rather with the torus:pit aperture ratio, since if the torus is relatively too narrow, air will seep in around the sides (Pittermann et al. 2010). Vascular tissue with tracheids only may be less hydraulically efficient than vascular tissue with vessels that have simple perforations, but they are tolerant of hydraulic stress and are resistant to cavitation, despite gymnosperms investing only about half as much as angiosperms in wall material - but at the same time they can make up the trunk of very large trees (Sperry 2003; Hacke et al. 2015); lipid surfactants in the xylem of angiosperms, at least, i.a. coat forming nanobubbles andprevent the formation of embolisms and they should be looked for here, too (Schenk et al. 2017). As Pitterman et al. (2005: p. 1924) note, "the evolution of the torus-margo membrane within the gymnosperm lineage from homogeneous pits was equivalent to the evolution of vessels within the angiosperms" (see also Wilson 2015; Hacke et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Another element in the control of water flow in conifers  is  transfusion tissue, groups of tracheid cells just outside the vascular bundles. These cells collapse as the leaf loses water and water deficits are not too great (<-3 MPa), but readily regain their size when the leaf becomes rehydrated. When collapsed, they reduce the flow of water from the xylem (Y.-J. Zhang et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The diameter of first order roots is linked to mycorrhizal type and how the plant forages for nutrients, and it varies considerably (W. Chen et al. 2013, 2016), but no comprehensive survey seems to have been carried out. </p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Litter and wood decay of gymnosperms in general is slower than that of angiosperms (e.g. Wardle et al. 2008; Cornwell et al. 2008b; Weedon et al. 2009), and root decay of conifers in particular is slower (Silver &amp; Miya 2001).  Brown rot fungi like boletes are common on conifers, and they can access much of the cellulose in the cell wall but they cannot destroy lignin; they have often evolved from white-rot fungi (e.g. Floudas et al. 2012; Kohler et al. 2015), although the basal dacrymycete <i>Calcera cornea</i> may have evolved from a soft-rot ancestor (Nagy et al. 2015). </p>
 
 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Many Pinaceae, ECM plants, grow successfully in low N conditions, while podocarps, AM plants, grow in low P conditions (Brodribb et al. 2012).</p>
 
 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Conifers frequently dominate the communities in which they grow, and are often long-lived plants; the high-light conditions they prefer are often associated with infrequent catastrophic disturbances that allow seedling establishment. Some emergent and apparently dominant conifers (often other than Pinaceae) may have have remarkably little effect on the forests in which they grow, the basal area of angiosperm trees in forests with and without these emergents, but which are otherwise comparable, being similar (Enright &amp; Ogden 1995; Aiba et al. 2007). </p>

 
 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Seventeen species of conifers in Pinaceae, Araucariaceae, and Cupressaceae, along with 29 species of Dipterocarpaceae, and especially <i>Eucalyptus</i>, are "giant trees" at least 70 m tall (Tng et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> For male cone variation and evolution, see Schulz et al. (2014). Much has been learned about pollination and pollen germination in conifers in the last few years, and this is summarized by Leslie et al. (2015a), although important work had been carried out about 80 years ago. Details of the fascinating story in Leslie et al. (2015a) depend on the topology of the tree used, which in Podocarpaceae, for instance, differs from that below (in such cases, data checked against Leslie et al. 2015b). Wind pollination is ubiquitous. The pollen grains directly impact the ovulate cones rather than being swept around them by a turbine-like action (Cresswell et al. 2007). There are correlations between the presence of pollen sacci or wings, exine thickness and structure, whether (no wings) or not (wings) the pollen is wettable/pollen buoyancy, ovule and cone orientation, and presence of a pollination drop (Tomlinson 1994; Little et al. 2014; Leslie et al. 2015a; for the composition of the pollination droplet, see Ziegler 1959; Nepi et al. 2009). It had been thought that the sacci on conifer pollen facilitated its dispersal by wind, however, they function more like water wings. The sacci help orient the pollen grains in the pollination droplet (Doyle &amp; O'Leary 1935; Salter et al. 2002 and references), or, more particularly, when the ovules are inverted, a common condition, the pollen grains are wetted and float up to the micropyle where the saccus orients the grain on the nucellus, separating and exposing the sulcus through which the pollen tube germinates (Salter et al. 2002; Leslie 2010b). Sacci also help in the selection of appropriate pollen grains during pollination. Thus the proportion of saccate to non-saccate pollen grains inside the ovules is higher than that outside (Leslie 2009).  Changes in pollination mechanisms seem not to be accompanied by changes in diversification rates, and although sacci have been lost several times, in no case have sacci re-evolved within esaccate clades, loss being something of a one-way street (Leslie et al. 2015a). The pollination droplet in <i>Phyllocladus</i> and many taxa with erect ovules is resorbed through the micropyle, and again the pollen grains are brought close to the nucellus; in <i>Juniperus communis</i> and other taxa this resorbtion may be an active process happening quite soon after the pollen grain lands (Mugnaini et al. 2007). There are further variants of these pollination mechanisms in Coniferales (Owens et al. 1998; Salter et al. 2002; Fernando et al. 2005 for references) and in other ancient gymnosperms (Leslie 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Recent work suggests that the pollen story may be more complex. Sacci may indeed increase the distance the pollen grain can travel before it falls to the ground, so facilitating wind dispersal (Schwendemann et al. 2007). However, this depends on the nature of the sacci; if they have extensive air sacs, as in <i>Pinus</i>, pollen is likely to travel further, but if the sacci are composed of denser material, as in <i>Falcatifolium</i>, the pollen will fall faster - as it may also if the surface of the pollen grain is not smooth (Grega et al. 2013). Furthermore, the pollination droplet may also be involved in insect pollination, as in a number of <a href="http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/top/gnetales.html#Gnetales" target="home">Gnetales</a>. For additional information on  pollination, see Doyle (1945), Tomlinson (1994, 2000, 2012), Tomlinson et al. (1997), and Tomlinson and Takaso (2002); see also Williams (2009).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is considerable variation in the development of the male gametophyte (Fernando et al. 2010: summary and terms used). The actual process of pollen germination varies, and the feature "pollen exine shed during microgametophyte germination", is likely to have evolved more than once (?three times) in Pinaceae alone (see also Rydin &amp; Friis 2005); for cell death induced by the growing pollen tube, see Fernando et al. (2005 and references). Proteins have been found in the pollination droplet, and these may be involved in defence against pathogens and in promoting male gametophyte development (Wagner et al. 2007).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For details of seed morphology, dispersal types, etc., and their evolution, see Contreras et al. (2016). Fleshy (the fleshiness is of several kinds) animal-dispersed seeds have evolved several times from winged seeds, but there have been no reversals, while the dry animal-dispersed seed type in <i>Pinus</i> has, hoever, reversed to the winged type (Contreras et al. 2016).  Bateman et al. (2011; see also Givnish 1980) note a correlation between dioecy and fleshy, animal-dispersed seeds and monoecy and dry, wind-dispersed seeds in gymnosperms, a correlation that is evident within Pinales. Leslie et al. (2013) suggest that this is largely due to the persistence of groups which are dioecious and have fleshy fruits and monoecious and have dry fruits; they note common transitions from the monoecy/fleshy to dioecy/fleshy combinations, although overall such features had little effect on diversification. Pollen and dry seed cone size in particular correlates with branch thickness, etc., in conifers; fleshy seed cones are notably smaller than dry cones (Leslie et al. 2014). Variation in seed size links with dispersal mechanisms - abiotic dispersal < seed subtended by attractant tissues < attractant issues part of the seed - and there are also correlations with clades (Leslie &amp; Beaulieu 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Herbivory in gymnosperms as a whole is relatively low  (Turcotte et al. 2014: see caveats). Conifers have layers of polyphenol-containing parenchyma cells in the phloem, possibly offering some protection against insects (Li et al. 2012), while Pinaceae have resin ducts in both phloem and xylem and other Pinales have resin ducts only in the xylem. These other Pinales also have large numbers of small, extracellular, calcium oxalate crystals and stratified phloem, while Pinaceae have scattered sclereid cells or sometimes groups of such cells (e.g. Hudgins et al. 2003; Franceschi et al. 2008: q.v. fot possible conifer apomorphies associated with these interactions). The different elements of the defences are constitutive and/or inducible, methyl jasmonate being part of the inductive pathway (e.g. Hudgins et al. 2003; Hudgins &amp; Franceschi 2004), and different herbivores elicit different responses by the plant (Moreira et al. 2013), and even within <i>Pinus</i> there is variation in how much particular defences are expressed constitutively (Carrillo-Gavil&aacute;n et al. 2014). See below for some details about the interactions between bark beetles, their associated fungi, and the conifer host.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Favret and Voegtlin (2004),  Meseguer et al. (2015) and R. Chen et al. 2016) discuss speciation of <i>Cinara</i> aphids, found on Cupressaceae and especially Pinaceae, see also below. Many of the wood-eating basal termites (their protozoans in theit guts can break down lignin) seem to like the wood of Pinales; the crown-group age of termites is Jurassic, ca (170-)149(-136) m.y.a. (Bourguignon et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> A number of rusts, including those on ferns, Rosaceae, Grossulariaceae, etc., have part of their life cycles on Pinales, especially Pinaceae (Savile 1979b). For foliar endophytes and their bacterial associates, see Hoffman and Arnold (2010). Basidiomycete brown rot fungi are common in coniferous forests and are also found in broad-leaved, more temperate forests, but they are at most uncommon in tropical forests (Gilbertson 1981); for the relationships of (and uncertain distinction between) brown and white rot fungi, see Riley et al. (2014), Nagy et al. (2015). For the blue-staining ascomycete fungi associated with ambrosia beetles, see below.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Chromosome number shows little variation in Pinales, and overall there is little polyploidy (Murray 2013; Scott et al. 2016). Conifers are noted for their very large nuclear genomes with 2C values of up to 72 pg (Zonneveld 2012); for 1C values, see the <a href="javascript:showImage('http://data.kew.org/cvalues/',600,500)">Plant DNA C-values Database</a> (consulted vi.2013). These massive genomes are the result of the activity of a number of transposable elements that is not counteracted by mechanisms for slimming genomes, as in angiosperms (Ahuja &amp; Neale 1005; Nystedt et al. 2013). Note, however, that genome size in Pinales is quite similar to that in other gymnosperms. Reductions in genome size have probably occurred in Podocarpaceae and in particular in <i>Gnetum</i>, so the increase in size in gymnosperms is not totally a one-way ticket (c.f. Bennetzen &amp; Kellogg 1997).  Leaf mass per unit area seems to be correlated with genome size, but this may be because of phylogenetic correlations (Beaulieu et al. 2007b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">However, Z. Li et al. (2015) suggested that there have been three duplications in the Pinales area, one in stem Pinaceae, another in stem [Taxaceae + Cupressaceae] (<i>Sciadopitys</i> was not examined), and a third in <i>Welwitschia</i>. However, Scott et al. (2016) emphasized the rarity of polyploidy in extant conifers, perhaps connected with their slow rate of diploidization; this suggestion was based on their study of the coast redwood, <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>, the only hexaploid in the whole group.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">C.-S Wu et al. (2011b) suggested that a different copy of the inverted repeat had been lost in Pinaceae (the IRb copy) and in the clade making up the rest of the order (the IRa copy). See also Raubesen and Jansen (1992a), Lackey and Raubeson (2008) and Hirao et al. (2008) for the loss of a copy of the inverted repeat. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is extensive duplication of the <i>knox</i>-1 gene within Pinaceae, at least, although more general sampling is needed to pin down the point at which this duplication occurred (Guillet-Claude et al. 2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For fatty acids in the seeds, see Wolff et al. (2002 and references), and for resin composition and gum production, see Tappert et al. (2011). Conifer lignin, primarily made up of guaiacyl units, is denser, more highly condensed, has a larger polymer size, etc., than the S-rich lignins of angiosperms (Wagner et al. 20915).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The interpretation of the stem apex in terms of the tunica-corpus layering is not easy (see Napp-Zinn 1966). I have not integrated much of the considerable variation in wood anatomy with the clades recognised here (see e.g. Zhou &amp; Jiang 1992 for information).  Cork cambium is often more or less deep seated, although in <i>Sequoia</i> and <i>Phyllocladus</i> (e.g.) is is superficial (M&ouml;ller 1882). Bark anatomy is very complex, but fortunately it has been studied in detail (e.g. Franceschi et al. 2008). Calcium oxalate microcrystals are commonly found in some cell walls throughout the group (Fink 1991; Hudgins et al. 2003: ?Cephalotaxaceae, Sciadopityaceae), but their distribution in other gymnosperms is unclear; they may be absent. Their position within tissues is linked with the development of fibres, the amount of resin secreted, etc. (Hudgins et al. 2003). There is generally a single trace per leaf, but if the leaves are opposite, there may be two traces, but then they fuse before they enter the petiole (Namboodiri &amp; Beck  1968a, b), and leaf traces can also make connections with xylem produced during the second and subsequent years (Maton &amp; Gartner 2005). Secondary growth (only phloem is produced) has been reported from the leaves of a number of conifers, including <i>Pinus longaeva</i>, the needles of which can live for 30 years or more (Ewers 1982; Hacke et al. 2015). Short shoots occur in a number of taxa (see D&ouml;rken et al. 2012 for a summary), and branch shedding, cladoptosis, which also occurs in taxa other than those with short shoots, is widespread (Burrows et al. 2007 and references). Organised bud meristems usually occur in the axils of only some leaves, although more cryptic meristems are quite widespread (Namboodiri &amp; Beck  1968a; Fink 1984; Burrows 1999, 2009); in taxa like <i>Pinus</i> and <i>Sciadopitys</i> axillary buds are much more common, although most produce short shoots.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bisexual strobili that have ovuliferous scales above the microsporangia, i.e., the same basic arrangement as in angiosperm flowers, are scattered through the clade (Flores-Renter&iacute;a et al. 2011). Basic cone morphology is very variable. Conifer seed cones have becoming more massive and strongly constructed since the Triassic, and particularly the Jurassic, presumably in reponse to animal predation pressure (Leslie 2011b).  Among extant taxa, <i>Taxus</i> has tiny female cones each with a single, erect ovule, but cones are often massive structures. The ovuliferous scale is often well-developed and the bract scale inconspicuous, or the bract and ovuliferous scales may be largely separate, as in <i>Pseudotsuga</i>, while in Cupressaceae there is little evidence of an ovuliferous scale in the mature cone, which consists largely of bract scales (Schulz &amp; Stutzel 2007; Rothwell et al. 2011 for references). Understanding details of the morphological evolution of cones will depend on advances in our understanding of the fossil record, and it is likely that heterochrony has been involved; Cupressaceae can be linked with the fossil Voltziaceae (e.g. Rothwell et al. 2011). Developmental studies may also be of value. Thus Englund et al. (2011) found that  gene expression patterns linked the epimatium of <u<>Podocarpus</i> with the ovuliferous scale of <i>Pinus</i> (see also e.g. Tomlinson &amp; Takaso 2002), but not with the aril of <i>Taxus</i>. However, when comparing the expression of these genes in Cupressaceae, no particular similarities were observable (Groth et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A branched pollen tube occurs sporadically in Pinales (Friedman 1987 for references). Male gametes need more study.  Some taxa have binucleate sperm cells, i.e., a cell plate does not form in the spermatogeneous cell, or, if it does, it is incomplete.  The male gametes here may be unequal in size, as in <i>Dacrydium</i>, and one may even be extruded from the cytoplasm, as in <i>Podocarpus</i> spp. and <i>Taxus</i>.  In at least some  <i>Gnetum</i>, <i>Podocarpus andinus</i>, and <i>Torreya taxifolia</i> two unequally-sized male <u>cells</u> are produced (Singh 1978 for literature; I am grateful to Ned Friedman for help in understanding this complicated pattern of variation). Double fertlization sometimes occurs in Pinales (Friedman 1992). The free-nuclear stage in the proembryo of Pinales is shorter than that of other gymnosperms, being only 5 or 6 rounds of nuclear division in Podocarpaceae and Araucariaceae and even fewer in other members of the order (Owens et al. 2003c). Embryo size is rather variable, although it is often rather larger than that of the common ancestor of extant seed plants; in <i>Pinus</i> it may be close to the length of the seed. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a classic study of both fossil and extant conifers, see Florin (e.g. 1951); see also Page (1990) and especially Gifford and Foster (1988), Farjon (2005b) for a bibliography and Farjon (2008) for an excellent general account; Debreczy and R&aacute;cz (2006) and Eckenwalder (2009) offer other general accounts.  See also Trapp and Croteau (2001a: resin biosynthesis), Geyler (1867), Barthelmess 1935, and Kumari (1963: nodal anatomy), M&ouml;ller (1882: cork cambium),  Napp-Zinn (1966: leaf anatomy), Den Outer (1967) and Schulz (1990), both phloem anatomy, much detail unincorporated, Zhou and Jiang (1992: wood anatomy); see also Sivak (1975: detailed study of saccate pollen), Owens et al.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Given the uncertainty in our knowledge of the relationships between the major seed-plant clades, direct links to <a href="Cycadales.html#Cycadales" target="home">Cycadales</a>, <a href="gnetales.html#Gnetales" target="home">Gnetales</a>, <a href="ginkgoales.html#Ginkgoales" target="home">Ginkgoales</a>, and <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#StemGroupEvolution" target="home">flowering plants</a> are provided; for general discussion on relationships, see <a href="Cycadales.html#extseedplantsrels" target="home">above</a> and for more discussion about the immediate relatives of Gnetales, see the <a href="gnetales.html#Gnetales" target="home">Gnetales</a> page.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within conifers, relationships are being substantially clarified. Pinaceae (<i>Pinus</i>, <i>Cedrus</i>, etc.) are sister to the rest, as a morphological cladistic analysis by Hart (1987) suggested some time ago (but c.f. Nixon et al. 1994; Doyle 1996b). Molecular data and additional morphological work largely confirm the relationships in the tree here, which is based on the work of Quinn et al. (2002: successive approximations weighting), see also Price et al. (1993), Tsumura et al. (1995: RFLP analysis, tree [unrooted] with the same topology as that used here), Kelch and Cranfill
(2000), Gugerli et al. (2001: e.g. the mitochondrial <i>nad</i>I gene), Rai et al. (2002, especially 2008a), and, more recently, the four-gene analysis of Leslie et al. (2012) with its excellent sampling (but not <i>Gnetum</i>, etc.) and Ruhfel et al. (2014). However, the topologies in the scenarios of Biffin et al. (2010b) are either [Pinaceae [Podocarpaceae + Araucariaceae]] or [Pinaceae + Sciadopityaceae, etc.]... Gnetales are here included in Pinales (see discussion on <a href="Cycadales.html#Cycadales" target="home">Cycadales</a> page), although I haven't moved them yet, being uncertain where they will actually go.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Producing evolutionary classifications, or classifications that emphasise one or two favored morphological characters, seems to remain popular with those working on conifers (e.g. Keng 1975; Melikian &amp; Bobrov 2000; Fu et al. 2004 [Nageiaceae and Podocarpaceae well separated], Bobrov &amp; Melikian 2006 [Araucariaceae and other conifers form a lineage quite distinct from Pinaceae and Sciadopityaceae]).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013) suggested an age of (161.2-)153.8-153.1(-150.1) m.y. for crown Pinaceae, He et al. (2012) an age of around 237 m.y. ago. Various divergence estimates were provided by Gernandt et al. (2008), e.g. dates of ca 184 m.y. (Jurassic) or  ca 136 m.y.a., while around 175 m.y. is the estimate in Leslie et al. (2012); crown and stem ages of 100 and 263 m.y.a. respectively were suggested by Quirk et al. (2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fossils assigned to Pinaceae have been dated to around 155 m.y.o. (Rothwell et al. 2012; see also Miller 1999).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Looking at things from a somewhat diferent point of view, Augusto et al. (2014) date confirmed ECM symbioses in gymnosperms, i.ee., these would be largely Pinaceae, to the mid-Cretaceous some 115 m.y.a., probable ECM symbioses here are dated to over 200 m.y.a. in the Late Triassic, while possible ECM symbioses may have occurred in the Permian, over 250 m.y. ago. Yet at the same time Augusto et al. (2014) warn about extrapolating from the ecophysiological proclivities of modern gymnosperms to rhose of early gymnosperms.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Approximate ages for crown-group Pinoideae are ca 168 or ca 133 m.y. (Gernandt et al. 2008) and ca 155 m.y. (He et al. 2012).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The recently-described <i>Pinus yorkshirensis</i>, a cone associated with needles in Lower Cretaceous deposits 131-129 m.y.o., forms a polytomy with extant and some other fossil species in morphological analyses (Ryberg et al. 2012). In morphological analyses, there is no strong support for Cretaceous fossils ascribed to the genus nesting within it (Klymiuk et al. 2011; Ryberg et al. 2011), while fossils assigned to <i>Pityostrobus</i>  are scattered through the family phylogeny (Ryberg et al. 2012).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Stem ages for <i>Pinus</i> are around 95 or 73 m.y.a. (B. Wang &amp; Wang 2014), ca 126 m.y.a. (He et al. 2012), ca 140 m.y. (X.-Q. Wang et al. (2000), ca 123 or 155 m.y. (Gernandt et al. 2008) or ca 180 m.y. (Lockwood et al. 2013: <i>Picea</i> is sister). Although Naumann et al. (2013) date the <i>Pinus</i>/<i>Picea</i> split to around 33.1-29.3 m.y.a., angiosperms were the focus of this study, but it is clear that estimates for the age of <i>Pinus</i> are pretty much around the clock. More: A stem-group age for <i>Pinus</i> of (132-)128(-124) m.y. was suggested by Eckert and Hall (2006), while Crisp and Cook (2011) suggested a stem-group age (<i>Pinus</i> and <i>Picea</i> diverge) of around the K/C boundary ca 65 m.y. ago. Estimates in Gernandt et al. (2008) are ca 87-72 m.y. for crown <i>Pinus</i>, while others are much older, 165-148 m.y. ago. Willyard et al. (2007) estimated upper (permineralized wood) and lower dates for divergence of <i>Pinus</i> subgenera of 85 and 45 m.y. respectively (for the latter, see also Magall&oacute;n &amp; Sanderson 2005), although there were bouts of speciation much later. On the other hand, Millar (1998) suggested that <i>Pinus</i> subgenera <i>Pinus</i> and <i>Strobus</i> and some sections had separated by the middle of the Cretaceous. Crown-group <i>Pinus</i> is estimated to be (96-)89(-80) m.y.o. by He et al. (2012; age rather similar in Gallien et al. 2015); the age of (80.1-)58.8(-45) m.y.o. was suggested by B. Wang and Wang (2014: some estimates older), with most BEAST crown-group ages for both subgenera being 22-20 m.y.a., although some are as much as 50 m.y. ago. Crown-group ages for <i>Pinus</i> are estimated at ca 87 or ca 72 m.y.a. by Gernandt et al. (2008), and here and elsewhere the stem can be very long - in this case, ca 70 and 50 m.y. respectively. For other divergence times within Pinaceae, see also X.-Q. Wang et al. (2000) and Lin et al. (2010).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a disussion on the biogeography of the family, see X.-Q. Wang and Ran (2014). <i>Pinus</i> seems to have been a mid-latitude (30-50<sup>o</sup> N) plant in the Cretaceous, but in the warm Palaeocene and Eocene it retreated to higher latitudes, although also persisting near the equator.  With the climatic deterioration of the Late Eocene-Oligocene, it moved back to mid latitudes while persisting at higher latitudes (Miller 1993). Indeed, in high latitude Canadian Eocene floras Pinaceae could be quite common (N. McIver &amp; Basinger 1999). He at al. (2012) looked at the origin of fire-associated traits in <i>Pinus</i>, and found that thick bark characterised the whole genus, with its origin being somewhere between 126-89 m.y.a. (age spreads greater), while very thick bark, branch shedding and serotiny were common in subgenus <i>Pinus</i>, whose diversification was dated at (96-)89(-80) m.y.a; grass-like seedlings were uncommon (He at al. 2012 noted that thick bark and serotiny were found in a few other Pinales). Indeed, in the mid Cretaceous the presence of shrubby angiosperms and ferns may have increased the prevalence of intense and rapidly-spreading fires, and conifer forests then may have been seriously affected, traits for various aspects of fires resistance evolving then, even if some conifer groups may have been driven to extinction (Gernandt et al. 2008; Belcher &amp; Hudspith 2016). Le Page (2003; see also X.-Q. Wang et al. 2000) thought that there was an episode of diversification in Pinaceae in the Palaeocene, while Lockwood et al. (2013) dated diversification of <i>Picea</i> to the middle Oligocene, only (37-)28(-21) m.y. ago. In <i>Abies</i> there is weak support for the Californian endemic <i>A. bracteata</i> being sister to the rest of the genus, and section <i>Balsamea</i> is apparently of hybrid origin; crown-group <i>Abies</i> is estimated to be (73.4-)48.6(-33.7) m.y.o. (Xiang et al. 2014).</p

><p style="text-indent: 30px;">Nuclear genome size in <i>Pinus</i> directly or indirectly correlates with a number of other features. Small genomes are associated with small seeds, wind (not animal) dispersal, invasiveness, fast growth, etc.; larger genomes are commoner in subgenus  <i>Strobus</i>, which has genomes averaging ca 32.8 pg compared to those of subgenus <i>Pinus</i> at 27 pg (Grotkopp et al. 2004).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> For general information, see Andersson (2005) and especially Brodribb et al. (2012) and Augusto et al. (2014); the ecology of Pinaceae along with that of other conifers is discussed briefly <a href="http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/orders/conifers.htlm#Conifers">above</a> and that of ECM Pinaceae is also discussed <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#EctomycorrhizalPlants">elsewhere</a>. Pinaceae are a noted ectomycorrhizal (ECM) clade and they dominate huge areas of mostly cool-temperate and boreal forests in the northern hemisphere where they are generally to be found on nutrient-poor soils, although in suitable conditions <i>Pinus</i>-dominated forests occur in Costa Rica (Janzen 1983) and even south of the equator, as in montane Sumatra (Map: from White et al. 2000; Andersson 2008).  
Pinaceae thrive in high-light conditions; they have high leaf mass per unit area and also a very high leaf area index, and although their seedlings have lower photosynthetic rates than those of angiosperms they tolerate leaf water stress better (Fu et al. 2012). Longevity of pine and spruce needles increases in colder, northern latitudes (<i>Picea</i> needles may live for 12 years or more - Reich et al. 2014a). For the most part Pinaceae are unable to compete in tropical broad-leaved rain forests (but see the relatively broad-leaved <i>Pinus krempfii</i>: Brodribb &amp; Feild 2008). W. Chen et al. (2016) noted that the three ECM Pinaceae included in their study of nutrient uptake from the soil had thick to very thick first-order roots  compared with other ECM plants and showed little response in terms of either ECM or rootlet proliferation in an environment where nitrogen was patchily distributed.  They suggest that this may be because in places where Pinaceae normally grow the soil is more homogeneous and has large amounts of persistent leaf litter.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Many Pinaceae tolerate burning. Fires open the forest canopy, so making conditions suitable for <i>Pinus</i> in particular, many species of which are adapted to fire-prone environments (Brodribb et al. 2012; see also Agee 1998; Schwilk &amp; Ackerley 2001; Keeley 2012; Pausas 2015).  He et al. (2012; see also Bond &amp; Midgley 2012) thought that thick bark resistant to low intensity fires and the shedding of dead lower branches that would tend to prevent crown fires evolved in <i>Pinus</i> around (147-)126(-105) m.y.a.; this is the age of stem <i>Pinus</i>, so it assumes that evolution of these features occurred as the genus split from the [<i>Picea</i> + <i>Cathaya</i>] clade. Very thick bark and serotinous cones are an ecological syndrome adapted to high intensity (crown) fires, and this syndrome is dated to (96-)89(-80) m.y.a., the age of crown-group <i>Pinus</i> (He at al. 2012). Those juveniles that have long and very dense needles covering the growing point (the grass stage) can also tolerate burning. Interestingly, although <i>Pinus</i> with its long needles  has relatively well-aerated and very flammable litter like that of many/most other gymnosperms, leaves/needles of many other Pinaceae are smaller and the litter is compact and much less flammable (Cornwell et al. 2015). When the phylogeny of Pinaceae settles down, one can start thinking about the evolution of this set of traits - small needles and non-flammable litter are probably derived, but what about the situation in <i>Pinus</i>? </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Estimates of live above-ground biomass in Pinaceae-dominated forests are in the order of 0.8-0.9 x 10<sup>6</sup> kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> perhaps even reaching 1.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> kg ha<sup>-1</sup> (see Franklin &amp; Dryness 1973). Figures for the total above + below ground carbon in boreal forests are about 505 PgC, ca 34.2 kgC m<sup>-2</sup>, and a  mean turnover time of (45.4-)53.3(-73.4) years (Carvalhais et al. 2014: tables S1 and S2). The fraction of biomass in the foliage decreases with latitude, that in the root tends to increase, both changes connected with the increased longevity of the needles and associated low values of new leaves produced annually in far northern conifers (Reich et al. 2014a: p. 13705 has it backwards; see Reich 2014b: fig. 2). Accumulation of non-flammable litter under genera like <i>Tsuga</i> and <i>Picea</i> can be massive, and it can also protect the trees against ground fires, while accumulation of litter under <i>Pinus</i>, much more flammable, is less (Cornwell et al. 2015 and references). Wood of Pinaceae, as in other conifers, is broken down mostly by brown rot fungi. These fungi cannot degrade lignin, but readily break down cellulose and hemicellulose, leaving behind brown, crumbly detritus that is very rich in lignin and resistant to decay (Boddy &amp; Watkinson 1995; see above).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Associated with the tolerance of many Pinaceae to burning is the fact that a number of species of <i>Pinus</i> in particular are pioneer plants that regenerate soon after a burn, and they can also be invasive species. Particularly in such situations, an association between Pinaceae and ECM suilloid basidiomycetes (including genera like  <i>Rhizopogon</i> and <i>Gomphidium</i>; see also below) is evident; <i>Suillus</i> in particular is noted for its association with <i>Pinus</i>, and its spores seem to be very widely dispersed (Hayward et al. 2015). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Complex ECM connections and networks can be built up, for example, fungi associated with Ericaceae-Arbutoideae in  western North America may also be ECM associates of <i>Pinus</i> (Bruns et al. 2002; Kennedy et al. 2012 and references), and such connections have important implications for regeneration. The oldest and the youngest individuals in <i>Pseudotuga menziesii</i> forests may be linked by ECM networks (Belier et al. 2010), although this may preferentially benefit the larger individuals (see Weremijewicz et al. 2016: there are similar phenomenon in AM associations).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Given the close association of ECM fungi and Pinaceae, knowledge of the age of the clades of both is of interest. Crown group ages for the origins of ECM clades of Agaricales were split about equally between the Late Cretaceous and Eocene, and for nearly all a Jurassic origin could be rejected; Pinaceae-associated fungi were linked with both the Eocene and the Late Cretaceous dates (Ryberg &amp; Matheny 2012). The ECM \sebacina clade (= Sebacinaceae - Wei&szlig; et al. 2016) in Sebacinales seems to have evolved on North American temperate Pinaceae (87-)57, 45(-30) m.y.a. (Tedersoo et al. 2014a: stem and crown fungal ages). Diversification rates in the basidiomycete <i>Russula</i> are highest in extratropical lineages/those associated with Pinaceae (Looney et al. 2015). However, many estimates suggest that Pinaceae had begun diverging long before these fungal dates (see above). Given current uncertainties over details of crown Pinaceae diversification, the relation between the evolution of ECM fungi and Pinaceae remains unclear. </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Large stems of some Pinaceae are quite frequently found very close together, whether because of vegetative growth  or because of the germination and establishment of seeds from an overlooked animal cache (Tomback &amp; Linhart 1990 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For aging and the bristlecone pine, <i>Pinus longaeva</i>, see Munn&eacute;-Bosch (2014 and references).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> See above, under the order. Pollination mechanisms are quite diverse (Little et al. 2014). Doyle and O'Leary (1935b) described the distinctive pollination in <i>Larix</i> and <i>Pseudotsuga</i> where the pollen, which lacks sacci, lands on an almost stigmatic extension of the integument, the margins of which tend to inroll; contact with the nucellus may (<i>Larix</i>) or may not (<i>Pseudotsuga</i>) be needed for pollen tubes to develop. The time from pollination to fertilization may be over a year and pollen germination can take months (Little et al. 2014 and references).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For details of seed morphology, dispersal types, etc., and their evolution, see Contreras et al. (2016). The shape of the wings in seeds of Pinaceae is largely determined by the shape of the cone scales (Diedrich &amp; Leslie 2016). A number of species of pine are serotinous, particularly those susceptible to crown fires (e.g. Hern&aacute;ndez-Serrano et al. 2013 and literature, see also above). Seeds of ca 20 species of <i>Pinus</i> (nearly all subgenus <i>Strobus</i>) lack wings and are primarily dispersed by nutcrackers and other corvids, and such seeds tend to be larger than those of their winged relatives - from which they have evolved four to twelve times (Contreras et al. 2016; see also Tomback &amp; Linhart 1990). One nutcracker may store some 32,00 seeds/hectare - and this is just for one species of pine in one season (Tomback &amp; Linhart 1990). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Pinaceae tend to show (weak) masting behaviour (Koenig &amp; Knops 2000).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u>  Ambrosia and bark beetles (Curculionidae-Scolytinae: see Wood 1982; Wood &amp; Bright 1992; Six 2012), highly derived weevils, seem to have an ancestral association with conifers - although this is perhaps questionable (Jordal et al. 2011). Bark beetles, some 3,700 species, make their gallery systems in phloem, and members of genera like the North American <i>Dendroctonus</i> and the Northern Hemisphere <i>Ips</i> can be highly noxious pests, and a few invade living pines (e.g. Franceschi et al. 2005; Six 2012).  Although the beetles tend to have relatively few hosts, outbreaks can be devastating, colonizing beetles being attracted to trees by pheromones produced by beetles that are already there (Kelley &amp; Farrell 1998 for host specificity; Franceschi et al. 2005). Drought conditions may make the trees more susceptible to attack, but other factors must also be involved (Netherer et al. 2015). Interestingly, bristlecone pine has high levels of constitutive expression of potential defensive compounds like (+)-&alpha;-pinene in its phloem unlike the situation in  other pines grpowing with it - over twenty time the amount in limber pine, <i>Pinus flexilis</i>, for example - and is not attacked by <i>Dendroctonus</i> (Bentz et al. 2016).</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Many bark beetles, the ambrosia beetles, are associated with blue-stain fungi, mostly ascomycetes such as the unrelated <i>Ophiostoma</i> and <i>Ceratocystis</i> as well as a few basidiomycetes, and these grow into the sapwood and help hasten the death of the infected tree (Franceschi et al. 2005). These beetles, some 3,400 species, mostly tunnel in dead or dying wood, although early-branching members of the ambrosia beetle clade may live in phloem. They are haplodiploids that show parental care. Adults have intricate cuticular invaginations in which they carry a fungus inoculum, and the beetle larvae eat yeast-like bodies proliferating from these fungi in the galleries they make (Jordal et al. 2000; Cognato et al. 2011 and references); the mouth-parts of the weevil are also much modified. Not only beetles and fungi, but yeasts, bacteria (some nitrogen-fixing), parasitoids of the beetles and fungus-eating nematodes all form part of a very complex association (e.g. Rivera et al. 2009: yeasts and bark beetles). Overall, angiosperm hosts are more common, the evolution of the ambrosia feeding habit, which happened  8 times or more,  being associated with shifts to angiosperms (Six 2012);  development of fungus cultivation is unreversed (Beaver 1989; Farrell et al. 2001; Jordal et al. 2008 and references, 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Understanding the details of the evolution of the defence system against such weevils  depend on conifer phylogeny (e.g. Hudgins et al. 2004), which is currently unclear. Hudgins et al. (2003, 2004) examined the diversity of bark beetles in conifers in the context of various plant structures that might be defences against such beasts.  The beetles eat the wood despite the resin ducts in both phloem and xylem in Pinaceae (e.g. Hudgins et al. 2004), although paradoxically other Pinales, which have resin ducts only in the xylem, nevertheless harbour a lower diversity of these beetles. There are also intracellular crystals, phenolics in phloem-associated cells, etc., which could be protective. Keeling and Bohlmann (2006a, esp. b) describe terpenoid diversity and conifer defence mechanisms, a complex subject; it is unclear just what is responsible for the considerable diversity of terpenoids here, although multisubstrate and multifunctional enzymes involved in terpenoid synthesis in <i>Picea sitchensis</i> (Sitka Spruce), for example, may well be responsible (Hamberger et al. 2011). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Despite these defences, blue-stain fungi, species from a few unrelated ascomycete genera that are carried by the beetles, can quickly invade the sapwood and render it non-functional, basically clogging it up and killing the plant surprisingly quickly. Some, at least, of these fungi (e.g. <i>Endoconidiophora polonica</i> on <i>Picea abies</i>, Norway spruce), detoxify the plant's defences against the weevil <i>Ips typographus</i> by beginning the breakdown of stilbenes (in the phenolic defences) and flavonoids (in the resin defences), i.e. the two major components of the plant's defences (S.-H. Li et al. 2012; Keeling &amp; Bohlmann 2006a). Genes involved in the synthesis of such compoounds are expressed in the infected pine, but nevertheless the amount of the products decline in the pine as they are used up by the fungus (Wadke et al. 2016), so neutralizing these defences against the weevil (DiGuistini et al. 2011; Wadke et al. 2016). See also Wood (1982) and Wood and Bright (1992) for the weevils.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Endophytes  of <i>Picea</i> (spruce) produce several metabolites toxic to the eastern spruce budworm (Findlay et al. 2003; Sumarah et al. 2010). Iason et al. (2011) tested monoterpenes for protection against herbivory by capercaillie, bank voles, slugs, or red deer; some, but not all, worked (see also Hamberger et al. 2011: defensive properties of diterpene resin acids). Pine needle phenolics and pine stem resins are constitutively more abundant in Nearctic than in Palaearctic <i>Pinus</i>, but there was no differernce between the two groups in how inducible these defences were (Carrillo-Gavil&aacute;n et al. 2014: seedlings examined). Mumm and Hilker (2006) discuss the chemical defence of pines against foliovores in particular; for conifer exudates, see Lambert et al. (2007a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some 70 species of Adelgidae (aphids) are restricted to Pinaceae, and include <i>Adelges piceae</i> and <i>A. tsugae</i>, serious introduced pests in North America, the wooly adelgid, <i>Adelges tsugae</i>, being a major pest of hemlock, <i>Tsuga canadense</i> (Havill et al. 2007). There are five different generations in a single life cycle, the sexual, gall-forming generation being on <i>Picea</i>; as with other aphids, vertically transmitted bacteria are part of this ecosystem (Havill &amp; Foottit 2007). <i>Cinara</i>, a genus of lachnine aphids with about 250 species, radiated on conifers beginning ca 50 m.y.a. (Meseguer et al. 2015; ) or (88.5-)78.5(-68.5) m.y.a. (R. Chen et al. 2016). It and other eulachnines  (all told, ca 290 species) grow only on conifers, but they are embedded in a clade in which the original host may have been angiosperms (R. Chen et al. 2016). <i>Cinara</i> itself is found mainly on <i>Pinus</i>, perhaps its original host, and also <i>Abies</i> and <i>Picea</i>, although some species feed on Cupressaceae (Meseguer et al. 2015; R. Chen et al. 2016). <i>Cinara</i> species live mosstly in the bark while other eulachnines feed on needles of Pinaceae alone (R. Chen et al. 2016). For speciation of <i>Cinara</i>, where closely-related species are found on different hosts, see Favret and Voegtlin (2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Cecidomyiid gall midges are quite common on North American members of the family (Gagn&eacute; 1989). See Powell et al. (1999) for other insect-conifer associations.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Most species of the dwarf mistletoe <i>Arceuthobium</i> (Santalaceae-Visceae) parasitize Pinaceae, with a few species also growing on <i>Juniperus</i> (Cupressaceae - Farjon 2008); they can be serious pests of <i>Pinus</i> in particular (Unger 1992).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Ectomycorrhizal associations are particularly common in Pinaceae, and appropriate ECM fungi may have to be introduced if <i>Pinus</i>, for instance, is to be grown successfully in areas in which it normally does not grow, although this may well not be necessary (see Hayward et al. 2015). Suilloid fungi are notably common on Pinaceae, perhaps because the fungi can establish ECM asssociations in early successional situations (Bruns et al. 2002; Hayward et al. 2015). Overall ECM fungal diversity may be low in such situations, but this is by no means always so for pine ECM communities (D. L. Taylor et al. 2013). Garcia et al. (2015 and references) suggest that the establishment of ECM associations may differ from those in flowering plants, genes of the common symbiotic pathway (for both ECM and AM associations) not being involved. <i>Pinus</i> and <i>Larix</i> in particular may also form ectendomycorrhizal associations with an ascomycete (Peterson 2013).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bacteria associated with a particular kind of ECM on <i>Pinus contorta</i>, tuberculate ECM, in which a cluster of root tips are  surrounded by hyphae (see ectendomycorrhizae above), are thought to fix nitrogen (Paul et al. 2007). Strains of <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> are <u>the</u> dominating bacteria in pine forests across North America, and although they are unable to fix nitrogen,  they seem to be able to metabolize aromatic carbon sources (VanInsberghe et al. 2015). Some Pinaceae have foliar bacterial endophytes that fix nitrogen (Carrell &amp; Frank 2014). In a final wrinkle of the story of how Pinaceae may acquire nitrogen, <i>Laccaria bicolor</i>, a brown rot fungus, took up nitrogen from springtails that it had first immobilized, and this nitrogen could be transferred to seedlings of <i>Pinus strobus</i> (Klironomos &amp; Hart 2001). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A number of rusts, including those on ferns, have their aecial stages on Pinales, especially Pinaceae (Savile 1979b; Durrieu 1980). These include the white pine blister rust, <i>Cronartium ribicola</i> (alternate host <i>Ribes</i>, Grossulariaceae), a serious pathogen of white pine and its relatives.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In <i>Pinus strobus</i> endophytes synthesize antifungal metabolites, effective against <i>Microbotryum violaceum</i>, parasitic on some Caryophyllaceae (Sumarah et al. 2010, 2011), and endophyte metabolites in spruce may be toxic to insects (Findlay et al. 2003). However, on occasion dark septate endophytes can reduce the growth of their hosts, although the relationship between the two is complex, being affected by the identity of the host, temperature, whether or not the host has established a relationship with ECM fungi, etc. (Reininger &amp; Sieber 2012 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> For the nuclear karyotype, see Murray (2013); extensive synteny in Pinaceae is long persistent. For genome size and evolution in <i>Pinus</i>, see Grotkopp et al. (2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For chloroplast genome rearrangements, notably extensive here, see Lin et al. (2010) and C.-S Wu et al. (2011a). The inverted repeat may be very much reduced in size in genera scattered throughout the famly (Jansen &amp; Ruhlmann 2012 for reference;see also  C.-S. Wu et al. 2011a, b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Mitochondrial transmission is maternal in <i>Pinus</i> (Neale &amp; Sederoff 1989; X.-R. Wang 1996); B. Wang and Wang (2014) discuss the complex history of mitochondrial inheritance in the genus.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Economic Importance.</b> The majority of the world's lumber comes from softwood, and the majority of that comes from members of Pinaceae [?details] - and over 20% of the species of <i>Pinus</i> alone are invasives (Gallien et al. 2015), and this is facilitated by their ability to form ECM associations with <i>Suillus</i> species whose spores are very widely dispersed (Hayward et al. 2015; Peay 2016 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Pinaceae, in North America species of <i>Pinus</i> and <i>Tsuga</i> in particular, can be very heavily infested by bark beetles, a variety of fungi, dwarf mistletoes, etc. (see above: plant-animal interactions), that kill the plants, especially when they are stressed. The effects of these organisms are exacerbated by the tendency of the conifers to be locally so abundant, and the die-offs have been very extensive. </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The diameter of first order roots seems to vary considerably (W. Chen et al. 2013: rather narrower than co-occuring angiosperms, China, 2016: rather broader than co-occuring angiosperms, U.S.A.). Schultz (1990) notes that there are no phloem fibres in Pinaceae. <i>Pinus</i> cuticular wax tubules look almost scalloped (c.f. commelinids!), but this is because the tubules are densely aggregated (Wilhelmi &amp; Barthlott 1997).  For the anatomy of <i>Pinus</i> needles, see D&ouml;rken and St&uuml;tzel (2012); needles of subgenus <i>Pinus</i> are often described as having two vascular bundles, but there is a single vascular bundles with two parts separated by a parenchymatic band, the whole being surrounded by a common bundle sheath. Adult plants of <i>Pinus</i> have  scale leaves alone on their long shoots; seedings may bear needles directly on long shoots.</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The seed coat of <i>Cedrus</i> is vascularized. The seed wing of Pinaceae is derived from the middle or stony layer of the integument. Cleavage polyembryony is common, as is true polyembryony (more than one archegonium is formed), but the seed generally contains only a single embryo.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For <i>Pinus</i>, see e.g. Mirov (1967: monograph), Richardson (1998: ecology and biogeography), and Farjon (2005a: monograph); for other Pinaceae, see Farjon (1990: general). For details of reproduction, see Owens and Molder (1979), for aspects of ovuliferous cone morphology and anatomy, see Hu et al. (1989), Napp-Zinn and Hu (1989), and Gernandt et al. (2011), for the embryo, see Buchholz (1931), for seed coat development, see Owens and Smith (1964), and for general information, see the <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.conifers.org/pi/index.htm',600,500)">Gymnosperm Database</a>. Esteban and de Palacios (2009) and Esteban et al. (2009) describe the wood anatomy of Abietoideae, and Braukmann et al. (2009) chart the extent of the loss of the <i>ndh</i> gene (see also Hirao et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Relationships within Pinaceae are unclear and have depended on the kind of data analysed (morphology, molecules) and methods of analysis (parsimony, Bayesian) - see Tsumura et al. (1995), Wang et al. (2000), Rydin and K&auml;llersj&ouml; (2002), Liston et al. (2006b), and Gernandt et al. (2008). Studying the mitochondrial <i>rps</i>3 gene, Ran et al. (2010) found that <i>Larix</i> and <i>Pseudotsuga</i> were sister to all other Pinaceae. However, the main problem is the position of <i>Cedrus</i> with respect to Abietoideae (<i>Abies</i>, <i>Keteleeria</i>, <i>Nothotsuga</i>, <i>Pseudolarix</i>, <i>Tsuga</i>) and Pinoideae (<i>Cathaya</i>, <i>Larix</i>, <i>Picea</i>, <i>Pinus</i>, <i>Pseudotsuga</i>) (Holman et al. 2010). Thus Wang et al. (2000) placed <i>Cedrus</i> sister to the rest of the family, Gernandt et al. (2008) and Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016) as sister to Abietoideae (see also  C. Hou et al. 2015), while Liu et al. (2010) retrieved the clade [<i>Cedrus</i> [<i>Abies</i> + <i>Keteleeria</i>]] as sister to the rest of the family, although <i>Tsuga</i> and <i>Pseudolarix</i> were not sampled; <i>Cathaya</i> and <i>Pinus</i> formed a clade. Holman et al. (2010) nicely summarize the morphological evidence that is compatible with the relationship of <i>Cedrus</i> to either of those groups, or as sister to the whole family.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In a study with exhaustive sampling of conventional Pinaceae and all other Pinales except for <i>Gnetum</i>, etc.,  Leslie et al. (2012) found the set of relationships [[<i>Cedrus</i> [<i>Pseudolarix</i> [<i>Nothotsuga</i> + <i>Tsuga</i>]] [<i>Abies</i> + <i>Keteleeria</i>]] [[<i>Pseudotsuga</i> + <i>Larix</i>] [<i>Pinus</i> [<i>Cathaya</i> + <i>Picea</i>]]]. The same two major groups were recovered by Lockwood et al. (2013), although major groupings were not the focus of that study and details of relationships within the two groups differed; see also He et al. (2012), Ruhfel et al. (2014), and C. Hou et al. (2015). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the phylogeny of <i>Pinus</i>, see Price et al. (1998), Syring et al. (2005), Gernandt et al. (2005, 2008, 2011), Eckert and Hall (2006), Parks et al. (2012) and Gallien et al. (2015). <i>Pinus</i> has two subgenera (see Gernandt et al. 2005 for an infrageneric classification). Leaves of subgenus <i>Pinus</i>, the hard pines, apparently have two vascular  bundles (but see above), the plesiomorphic condition, while those of subgenus <i>Strobus</i>, the soft pines, have but a single bundle (references in Gallien et al. 2015 for studies on individual subgenera). <i>Picea</i> was embedded in <i>Pinus</i> is  Sen et al. (2016). Analysis of nuclear ITS variation was largely uninformative in suggesting relationships between sections in <i>Abies</i>, but at lower levels was more useful (Xiang et al. 2009); in a more extensive study (genes from all three compartments), Xiang et al. (2014) largely resolved relationships in the genus. Lockwood et al. (2013) provide a detailed phylogeny of <i>Picea</i>, sister to <i>Pinus</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> If the topology suggested by Leslie et al. (2012) holds up, a two subfamily classification, Abietoideae and Pinoideae, the subfamilies being the two major clades recognized there, is reasonable (see above).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Botanical Trivia</b> Living up to 4,700 years or more, the bristlecone pine, <i>Pinus longaeva</i>, is the longest-living non-clonal seed plant (Munn&eacute;-Bosch 2014 and references); its needles, which can live for over 30 years (Hacke et al. 2015), are the longest-lived leaves of all land plants except <i>Welwitschia</i> - and those are very odd leaves. The plant does not seem to attract native mountain pine beetles (<i>Dendroconus</i>, see Bentz et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Divergence of <i>Wollemia</i> from other Araucariaceae has been dated to a mere (37-)18(-younger) m.y.a. (Crisp &amp; Cook 2011); on the other hand, Leslie et al. (2012) dated the divergence of <i>Araucaria</i> from the [<i>Wollemia</i> + <i>Agathis</i>] clade to 185-165 m.y. - or perhaps around 167.2 m.y. (Laenen et al. 2014) or 205 m.y. (see also St&ouml;ckler et al. 2002; Wallis &amp; Trewick 2009), Kunzmann (2007) put the divergence of <i>Agathis</i> and <i>Wollemia</i> at at least 110 m.y.a., and Biffin et al. (2010b) suggest ages of (215-)191(-169) or (94-)65(-47) m.y.; 225-185 m.y. is the estimate in Knapp et al. (2007) and 172-162 m.y. in  Wilf and Escapa (2014, q.v. for other dates).  Dating here is in more than its normal mess.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Araucariaceae are well known as fossils from the Mid Jurassic (ca 175 m.y.a.) onwards. <i>Araucaria</i> in particular is found in even older Triassic deposits in many parts of the world in both hemispheres; the remarkably preserved <i>A. mirabilis</i> in Patagonian middle Jurassic deposits ca 160 m.y.o. has been associated with the monotypic section <i>Bunya</i> (Florin 1963; Stockey 1982, 1994; Hill &amp; Brodribb 1989; Kunzmann 2007). However, identification of <i>Araucarioxylon</i> wood can be difficult (Ash &amp; Creber 2000).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  Biffin et al. (2010b, esp. 2011b) noted that stem-group calibration scenarios make crown-group divergence of Araucariaceae largely a (mid-Cretaceous to) Caenozoic phenomenon (see also Crisp &amp; Cook 2011). This would question both the placement of the early fossils just mentioned in extant sections of <i>Araucaria</i> and the long-term persistence of <i>Agathis</i> in New Zealand since the Eocene or before; Knapp et al. (2007) also discuss this possible persistence. Although many floristic elements in the island that are known fossil there in the Oligocene-Miocene subsequently became extinct, their contemporary representatives being relatively recent immigrants (e.g. Jordan et al. 2010; Puente-Leli&egrave;vre et al. 2012), the distinctive frog <i>Leiopelma</i>, for example, may be an ancient lineage ?persisting on the islands (Carr et al. 2015). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The current southern distribution of <i>Araucaria</i> is best interpreted as a relict of a much more widespread range (Stockey 1982; Hill &amp; Brodribb 1989; Kunzmann 2007; Givnish &amp; Renner 2004; Kooymnan et al. 2014 for discussion).  <i>Agathis</i> was until recently thought to be Australian, but well-preserved and abundant fossils have turned up in Patagonian Eocene deposits about 52.2 m.y.; they were previously identified as <i>Zamia</i> (Wilf et al. 2014), and <i>Araucaria</i> is also known from that area (Markhofer et al. 2015). <i>Dilwynites</i> pollen is similar to that of <i>Wollemia</i> and some species of <i>Agathis</i> (so it could be the stem group of these genera); it is widely disributed in austral areas, being first known from the Late Cretaceous up to 93.9 m.y.a. (Mcphail et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although <i>Araucaria</i> is diverse on New Caledonia, there is little genetic divergence between the species, suggesting that the genus has not been there long (Gaudeul et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The quite recent discovery very close to Sydney of a few trees of the remarkable <i>Wollemia</i>, very similar to some fossil Araucariaceae (Jones et al. 1995; see e.g.  Pastoriza-Pi&ntilde;ol 2007 for a general account), occasioned some excitement. However, if <i>Wollemia</i> diverged from other Araucariaceae less than 37 m.y.a. (Crisp &amp; Cook 2011), comparison of <i>Wollemia</i> with these Cretaceous fossils may be inappropriate (c.f. Chambers et al. 1998).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For possible apomorphies, perhaps including "dehiscent" seeds (i.e. seeds separating from the cone-scale), see Cantrill and Raine (2006) and Escapa and Catalano 2013: most quantitative). Apomorphies for the family may be affected by the position of <i>Wollemia</i> within it.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Leaves in <i>Araucaria</i> may stay on the plant for 25 years or so (reference in Chabot &amp; Hicks 1982).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> The time from pollination to fertilization in <i>Agathis australis</i> is about twelve months, although this includes three months after pollination before the pollen grain germinates, and then another three months over winter when nothing much happens (Owens et al. 1995b).   The pollen grains do not rupture when placed in water (Tomlinson 1994).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Sequeira and Farrell (2001) suggested that the association between <i>Araucaria</i> and the scolytine Tomicini bark beetles is Cretaceous in age; the beetles seem to have moved on to <i>Araucaria</i> from angiosperms, and from thence moved on to Pinaceae. Garc&iacute;a Massini et al. (2011) found evidence of wood-boring beetles, fungi, and mites in fossilized araucarian wood of Middle Jurassic age from Argentinian Patagonia.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Caterpillars of Agathiphagidae, a small group of near-basal jawed lepidoptera, eat seeds of <i>Agathis</i>, and they are known from Australia to the Pacific (Shields 1988; Powell et al. 1998). It has been suggested that they diverged from the <i>Nothofagus</i>-eating Heterobathmidae as much as 158.5 m.y.a. (Wahlberg et al. 2013), although on balance a position of Agathiphagidae sister to Micropterigidae, together forming the basal branch of the lepidopteran clade, is favoured (Regier et al. 2015; Kristiansen et al. 2015).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For the essential oils of <i>Wollemia</i>, see Staniek et al. (2010 and references), and for a possible taxol-producing endophyte, see Strobel et al. (1997). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Tomlinson (2008) noted that the axillary branches of <i>Wollemia</i> are evident in the resting terminal bud, but do not grow out until extension growth of the latter starts; there are undifferentiated resting meristems in the axils of the leaves of the main axis which develop if the apical meristem is destroyed (Tomlinson &amp; Huggett (2011). The single leaf trace divides into three or more as it proceeds into the leaf (Tomlinson 2008; Tomlinson &amp; Murch 2009), and this may be connected with branch shedding or cladoptosis, which is particularly striking here (Looy 2013 and references). Araucariaceae also have platelet structures in their cuticular waxes (Wilhelmi &amp; Barthlott 1997); the stomata of <i>Araucaria</i> have a wax plug which may block penetration of fungal hyphae (Mohammadian et al. 2009 - see also Winteraceae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Cones of <i>Araucaria</i> have a "ligule" that is more or less adnate to the ovule. The seeds of <i>Wollemia</i> have integumentary wings, unlike the seeds of other members of the family (Contreras et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Stockey (1982), Bieleski and Wilcox (2009), Gee and Tidwell (2010: literature from late Triasssic to end Cretaceous), and especially the <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.conifers.org/ar/index.htm',600,500)">Gymnosperm Database</a>, for comparative anatomy, see Thompson (1913), for axillary buds, see Burrows (1999 and references, 2009), for details of reproductive biology compared with those of other Pinales, see Owens et al.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> <i>Wollemia</i> has been placed variously sister to <i>Agathis</i> or sister to the rest of the family (Jones et al. 1995; Gilmore &amp; Hill 1997; Setoguchi et al. 1998; S. S. Renner in Kunzmann 2007), the particular position being sensitive to the choice of outgroups (Knapp et al. 2007). A [<i>Wollemia</i> + <i>Agathis</i>] clade was retrieved in the comprehensive four-gene tree in Leslie et al. (2012) and by Escapa and Catalano (2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  Although Podocarpaceae are still quite common and may dominate the vegetation, they are largely restricted to the southern hemisphere, and are well known as fossils from Antarctica; for their biogeography, see Mill (2003), Kooyman et al. (2014), etc.. Some Podocarpaceae currently not growing in the New World are known from Palaeocene/Eocene deposits in Argentinia (Kooyman et al. 2014; Merkhofer 2015 for references). There are also well-substantiated reports of members of the family from the northern hemisphere in the Cretaceous and Early Caenozoic, e.g. <i>Prumnopitys anglica</i> from Eocene southeast England (Greenwood et al. 2013 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Extant Podocarpaceae with broad leaves are shade tolerant and prefer warmer and higher rainfall conditions (c.f. Cupressaceae and other Podocarpaceae with narrower, imbricate leaves), and as Australia dried out during the Caenozoic, podocarps became less common there (e.g. Brodribb &amp; Hill 1997, 2004; Biffin et al. 2011b). Diversification in clades whose members have imbricate leaves began in the Late Jurassic ca 150 m.y.a. (Biffin et al. 2011b) or earlier (Quiroga et al. 2016). Diversification in clades whose members have flattened foliage is notably greater, but younger, and is dated to (94-)64(-38) m.y.a. (c.f. Biffin &amp; Lowe 2011; Biffin et al. 2011b; Brodribb &amp; Feild 2010), and crown-group <i>Podocarpus</i>, with 107 species representing well over half the family, is (81.8-)65.2, 60(-52.2) m.y.o., i.e. late Cretaceous or early Palaeogene, although it could be up to 37 m.y. older (Quiroga et al. 2016).  Leslie et al. (2012) and Quiroga et al. (2016) offer more dates for splits within Podocarpaceae. <i>Dacrydium</i> may have moved into South East Asia via the Ninety East Ridge and India (Morley 2011). For possible roles of New Caledonia and New Zealand in the persistence of Podocarpaceae, see Condamine et al. (2016: metapopulations on ephemeral islands?). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Podocarps are  slow-growing, long-lived, light-demanding specialists that often grow in nutrient-poor soils, but are mostly poorly adapted to dessication stress; they can be dominants or emergents in southern forests (Brodribb 2011; Coomes &amp; Bellingham 2011). Their leaves decompose only slowly (although there are few studies on this), with a high concentration of condensed tannins (Ushio et al. 2017), carbon/lignin build up in the soil, nutrients are sequestered, and soil fertility is further reduced (Wardle et al. 2008); they have been described as ecosystem engineers because of this combination of features (Coomes &amp; Bellingham 2011). Soils beneath the tree may be low in both N and P, but <i>Dacrydium gracilis</i>, at least, effectively removes the little inorganic N that is there, while saprophytic microbes may contribute to the  high acid phosphatase activity in the soil which relieves the P limitation (Ushio et al. 2017).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are often root nodules in Podocarpaceae. The roots involved tend to be superficial, and the nodules may be in longitudinal rows and represent modified lateral roots (Becking 1965; Duhoux et al. 2001). The fungus <i>Glomus</i> is involved, and nitrogen does not seem to be fixed (Russell et al. 2002), however, what these nodules might do is poorly understood (Dickie &amp; Holdaway 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Biffin and Lowe (2011, see also Biffin et al. 2011b) suggest that podocarps with broad leaves or functionally equivalent structures like the phylloclades of <i>Phyllocladus</i> evolved about four to six times. This has been dated to a time slightly after the venation density of angiosperm leaves increased - (94-)64(-38) versus 109-60 m.y.a.. These broad-leaved podocarps are now largely meso-megathermal shade-tolerant plants (high rates of transitions from microthermal) while the imbricate-leaved taxa are mostly microthermal (high rates of transitions from meso-megathermal: Biffin &amp; Lowe 2011; Biffin et al. 2011b; Brodribb &amp; Feild 2010). Fossils with apparent affinities to podocarps and with broad leaves are also known from the Triassic and Jurassic (Biffin et al. 2011b).</p> 


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The New Caledonian <i>Parasitaxus usta</i> is hemiparasitic on the roots of <i>Falcatifolium taxoides</i>, another podocarp, where it taps the xylem and from which it obtains water and nutrients (the stomata of <i>Parasitaxus</i> are insensitive to light), and is also a mycoheterotroph, obtaining carbon from an ?ectomycorrhizal fungus that is also associated with its host and whose hyphae grow through the vascular systems of both host and parasite (Woltz et al. 1994; Feild &amp; Brodribb 2005; Merckx et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> There is a correlation between the absence of pollen wings and the shedding of the pollen exine when the microgametophyte germinates. In <i>Phyllocladus</i>, which has erect ovules, the pollination droplet is actively resorbed (see Tomlinson et al. 1991, esp. 1997: useful comparisons; Rydin &amp; Friis 2005). For pollen tube growth in <i>Saxegothaea</i>, see Doyle and O'Leary (1935a); if that genus is sister to the rest of the family, one may have to rethink aspects of the evolution of pollination mechanisms in Podocarpaceae (c.f. Leslie et al. 2015). See also Little et al. (2014) for pollination.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For details of seed morphology, dispersal, etc., and their evolution, see Contreras et al. (2016); the diaspores are usually fleshy and animal-dispersed, the epimatium/ovuliferous scale  being variously developed and more or less surrounding the seed.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> <i>Phyllocladus</i> has phylloclades, flattened, photosynthetic stems; these bear highly reduced, scale-like leaves which may lack leaf gaps, and it is in the axils of these leaves that the reproductive structures are found.  The seedling has more conventional needle-like leaves. The foliar units of podocarps with flattened foliage units, whether leaves or phylloclades, have transfusion tissue or there are several veins, unlike the single vein and absence of transfusion tissue in the leaves of other podocarps (Biffin et al. 2011b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Quinn et al. (2002) noted a tendency to dysploid chromosome evolution in the group. 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For secondary metabolites in <i>Podocarpus</i> s.l., see Abdillahi et al. (2010); taxol has been found in <i>Afrocarpus gracilior</i> (fungi involved here, too?). Accessory transfusion tissue extends to the lamina margin in <i>Podocarpus macrophyllus</i> and a number of other species of the genus (Gifford &amp; Foster 1989); Knopf et al. (2012) provide many details of foliar anatomy for the whole group.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The morphological nature of the epimatium has occasioned some controversy. Chamberlain (1935) interpreted it as possibly being equivalent to the ovuliferous scale (see also Tomlinson &amp; Takaso 2002; Englund et al. 2011: similarity confirmed by gene expression data), and functionally, perhaps, it can be considered equivalent to the  second integument of an angiosperm ovule - hence the "anatropy" of the ovules here (Endress 2011b). The epimatium may be free from or adnate to the integument (see also  Contreras et al. 2016 for fruit morpgology). <i>Phyllocladus</i> is sometimes described as having an aril, although this is more probably a somewhat reduced and retarded epimatium (de Laubenfels 1988). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The pollen of <i>Phyllocladus</i> has often been described as having a wing (e.g. Singh 1978), but a wing seems to be absent. Although the single ovules of most Podocarpaceae do seem very different from the multiovulate cones of most other Pinales, Lower Cretaceous podocarps with more conventional bract-scale complexes, as in the extant <i>Saxegothaea</i>, have been described (X. Wang et al. 2008). For details of embryogeny, see Buchholz (1941), and for nucleus number in the E-tier cells, see also Quinn (1986). Cleavage and true polyembryony are common in Podocarpaceae, indeed, embryos seem able to develop from almost any cell of the early embryo (Buchholz 1941; for polyembryony, see also  Doyle and Brennan (1972: integrate this character better).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For <i>Podocarpus</i>, see Mill (2014: summary of literature) and for <i>Phyllocladus</i>, see Quinn (1986: embryogeny) and Tomlinson et al. (1989: cone, etc.). For general information, see Turner and Cernusak (2011: <i>Smithsonian Contrib. Bot.</i> 95. 2011), and the <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.conifers.org/po/index.htm',600,500)">Gymnosperm Database</a>, and for cuticle morphology, see Mills and Schilling (2009) and for wood anatomy, see Woltz et al. (2009 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For  phylogeny, see also Kelch (1998), a comparison of morphology and molecules. <i>Rbc</i>L analyses (Conran et al. 2000; Wagstaff 2004b) tended to place <i>Phyllocladus</i> within Podocarpaceae, other analyses, whether (Quinn et al. 2002) or not (Sinclair et al. 2002) including <i>rbc</i>L sequences, placed the two as sister groups. Inclusion in Podocarpaceae is likely, as  in Peery et al. (2008: nuclear XDH gene), and it was in the small prumnopityoid clade in the combined analysis of Knopf et al. (2012: support in/for this clade not strong in single gene analyses; see also Biffin et al. 2011a, b; Quiroga et al. 2016). Other groupings of genera are becoming evident (Kelch et al. 2010), including the dacrydioid and podocarpoid clades (Knopf et al. 2012). The closest relatives of <i>Parasitaxus</i> are <i>Lagarostrobus</i> and <i>Manoao</i>, from Tasmania and New Zealand - [<i>Parasitaxus</i> [<i>Lagarostrobus</i> + <i>Manoao</i>]] (Sinclair et al. 2002; Rai et al. 2009; Lam et al. 2009; c.f. Quiroga et al. 2016: <i>Lagarostrobus</i> in a different part of the family). <i>Saxegothaea</i> has some support as being sister to all the rest of the family (Knopf et al. 2012, but c.f. Biffin et al. 2011a, b; Quiroga et al. 2016: sister to [<i>Microcachrys</i> [<i>Pherosphaera</i> [<i>Acomopyle</i> + ...]]]; Leslie et al. 2012). This has considerable implications for character evolution in the clade; as Mabberley (2007) noted, the plant has some features reminiscent of Araucariaceae.  For relationships within <i>Podocarpus</i>, see Biffin et al. (2011, 2012) and Quiroga et al. (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> <i>Phyllocladus</i> has long been considered very distinctive, so distinctive that it has sometimes been separated from all other conifers (e.g. Keng 1974, 1979).</p>

Whether or not all taxa have male gametes each surrounded by cell walls needs to be confirmed (see Singh 1978).</p>

<ul><li>Sciadopityaceae have needle-like "leaves" borne in loose umbrella-like whorls at the end of the each innovation.  Each "leaf" is borne singlyand is axillary to a scale leaf. It is made up of two largely connate needles and is notched at the apex; it is comparable with the fascicles of separate needles in Pinaceae.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Fossils of <i>Sciadopitys</i> are known since the Upper Cretaceous, but apart from material from Japan and the Upper Pliocene of Germany, the identities of many are questionable (Stockey et al. 2005).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> There has been much debate over whether the photosynthesising structures of<i>Sciadopitys</i> are some kind of phylloclade - perhaps formed by the connation of two leaves - or cladodes, basically stem structures. The two vascular bundles, each with its own endodermis, tend to have have abaxial xylem and adaxial phloem, a rather odd arrangement. Sporne (1965) noted that on occasion branches develop from these leafy structures, so perhaps favoring the cladode hypothesis (see also Farjon 2005c). However, D&ouml;rken and St&uuml;tzel (2011) examined probably only the second known case of intermediate structures, and consider the photosynthesizing structures to be two congenitally connate needle leaves, the orientation of the vascular tissue resulting from the relation of the leaves to the axis that bore them (see also D&ouml;rken &amp; St&uuml;tzel 2012). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For the Middle Jurassic ca 173 m.y.o. fossil <i>Scitistrobus duncaanensis</i>, see Spencer et al. (2015); it has some similarities with Voltziales, e.g. the ovules are attached to to the free tips of the ovuliferous scale, but in the compact cone, etc., it is assignable to Cupressaceae, and that is where Spencer et al. place it. >There is a rich Cretaceous fossil record of cupressoid plants like <i>Elatides</i> and <i>Hughmillerites</i> that have ovuliferous scales and spiral cone scales, plesiomorphic features, and several of these fossils may form a clade with extant <i>Cunninghamia</i>, even if, as might be expected with fossil material, support is not overwhelming (Shi et al. 2014). Their fossil record, from the northern hemisphere and stretching back to the Late Jurassic ca m.y.a. (Rothwell et al. 2011), suggests that plants with similar morphologies formed an important early radiation in Cupressaceae (e.g. Shi et al. 2014; Atkinson et al. 2014). <i>Cunninghamia</i> itself is known from the Late Cretaceous (Buczkowski et al. 2015 and references). Herrera et al (2016) review fossils that can be linked to <i>Cunninghamia</i> and <i>Taiwania</i> (these are basal clades of Cupressaceae). The largely New Guinean <i>Papuacedrus</i> is known from Eocene deposits in Argentinia  (Wilf et al. 2009; see also Kooyman et al. 2014: this and other genera).  Wilf and Escapa (2014) suggest some fossil-based dates within this clade.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Cupressoideae are predominantly northern in their current distributions and Callitroideae are predominantly southern, a vicariance pattern that may reflect the break-up of Pangaea (see also X.-Q. Wang &amp; Ran 2014 for a summary). The split between the two is  dated to (183-)153(-124) m.y. or (193.2-)178.2-143.0(-134.3) m.y. (Mao et al. 2012; see Z.-Y. Yang et al. 2012 for more dates).  However, there has been much E.-W. and some N.-S. movement even of extant genera, thus the southern <i>Widdringtonia</i> is found in 97 m.y.o. rocks from North America (McIver 2001) and northern Sequoioideae in rocks from the Upper Cretaceous of Queensland (Peters &amp; Christophel 1978: its leaves are like those of the southern <i>Arthrotaxis</i>). Crown Callitroideae have been dated to 71.9-51.9 m.y. (Leslie et al. 2012: other estimates older), and crown Cupressoideae are somewhat older. However, the age of a clade including <i>Sequoia</i>, Callitroideae, and Cupressoideae has also been estimated at a mere 66.4 m.y. (Magall&oacute;n et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There was much Caenozoic extinction, probably around the Oligocene-Miocene boundary ca 23 m.y.a., and diversification in extant genera can be dated to after this period (Crisp &amp; Cook 2011; Mao et al. 2012; Pittermann et al. 2012). Pittermann et al. (2012; see also Edwards &amp; Donoghue 2013) suggested that <i>Juniperus</i> and <i>Cupressus</i> s.l., most of whose species have become adapted to dry conditions and have developed cavitation-resistant xylem, diverged 38.7-32 m.y.a., while figures in Leslie et al. (2012) are 53-33 m.y. (and some much older). Mao et al. (2010; see also Adams &amp; Schwarzbach 2013) throught that there was E->W migration across the North Atlantic Land Bridge in <i>Juniperus</i>, initially Eurasian in distribution, around 47-30.3 m.y.a. (see see Mao et al. 2010 for more dates). Arid-adapted members of Callitroideae diversified some 52.6-34 m.y.a. (Pittermann et al. 2012); Leslie et al. (2012) suggest that diversification began a little before the K/T boundary ca 65.5 m.y.a. and continued throughout the Caenozoic. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">If the basal topology of the family [Cunninghamioideae [Taiwanioideae [Athrotaxidoideae [....]]] is confirmed (see below), then features common to these genera (e.g. Atkinson et al. 2014) will be features for the family as a whole, while loss of ovuliferous scales and other characters are best placed within the family and are not apomorphies for it. For apomorphies for basal members of Cupressaceae, somewhat adjusted above, see Schulz and St&uuml;tzel (2007: unfortunately <i>Juniperus</i> etc. not included), for wood anatomy and phylogeny, see Rom&aacute;n-Jord&aacute;n et al. (2016).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u>  Biomass estimates for <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i> are 2.3 x 10<sup>6</sup> kg ha<sup>-1</sup> (Franklin &amp; Dryness 1973).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For details of xylem function in relation to the environment in Cupressaceae, see Pittermann et al. (2010). The initial preferences for the family were mesic conditions, but Pittermann et al. (2012) noted that a number of species of  both Cupressoideae and Callitroideae had evolved drought resistance, their xylem-specific conductivity and stomatal conductances being lower, and also their CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates were much reduced. The cost of these adaptations was slow growth.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> For the active and irreversible withdrawal of pollination drops within half an hour of deposition of pollen, see D&ouml;rken and Jagel (2014); this happens also when there is pollen from other Cupressaceae in the pollination drops, but not when there is pollen from angiosperms or <i>Pinus</i>. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In <i>Cupressus dupreziana</i> paternal apomixis, a phenomenon unknown from any other seed plant, occurs; here the embryo develops from unreduced male gametes (Pichot et al. 2000, 2001).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For details of seed morphology, dispersal, etc., and their evolution, see Contreras et al. (2016); dry and winged (the wings come from the ovules) seeds are common, but <i>Juniperus</i> is noted for its fleshy disseminules.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> The telial stage of <i>Gymnosporangium</i> rust is common on some Cupressaceae, especially <i>Juniperus</i>, while the aecial stage characterises Rosaceae-Maloideae (Savile 1979b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> See  Zonneveld (2014) for discussion of genome size in taxa like <i>Juniperus</i>; there are connections with polyploidy, as elsewhere in Pinales.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Cryptomeria japonica</i> has a much reduced inverted repeat with few genes duplicated in it (Hirao et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Characters of wood anatomy may yield phylogenetically interesting variation (Schulz &amp; St&uuml;tzel 2007), but state delimitation is difficult; for epidermal morphology, see Ma et al. (2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Proliferation of the ovuliferous cones is common, and the distribution of this feature, too, may be of phylogenetic interest (Schulz &amp; St&uuml;tzel 2007). Scales on the ovuliferous cones are wedge-shaped to peltate. Most Cupressaceae lack ovuliferous scales, having only bract scales (Zhang et al. 2004; see also Farjon 2005c), but <i>Cryptomeria</i> has several "teeth" on the ovuliferous scale - perhaps a reversion to a plesiomorphic morphology (see also Schulz &amp; St&uuml;tzel 2007).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a monograph (and far more) see Farjon (2005c); general information can of course be found in the <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.conifers.org/cu/index.htm',600,500)">Gymnosperm Database</a>. For cone and ovule morphology, see Farjon and Garcia (2003 and references) and Takaso and Tomlinson (1989, 1990, 1992).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Page (1990) suggested that there were "fundamental" differences between Cupressaceae and Taxodiaceae in the morphology of their reproductive parts, but in the tree of Quinn et al. (2002) Cupressaceae s. str. are embedded in a paraphyletic Taxodiaceae which form a basal grade. Phenetic analyses had earlier suggested the combination of the two (Eckenwalder 1976), and they are combined in Farjon (2005c). For relationships within Cupressaceae, see Brunsfeld et al. (1994), Gadek et al. (2000), Kusumi et al. (2000), Farjon et al. (2002), Brunsfeld et al. (2003), and  Little et al. (2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The basic phylogenetic structure of the family is probably [Cunninghamioideae [Taiwanioideae [Athrotaxidoideae [Sequoioideae [Taxodioideae [Cupressoideae + Callitridoideae]]]]]] (Mao et al. 2012: support, inc. for basal branches, usu. strong; Sen et al. 2016; Z.-D. Chen et al. 2016: no <i>Athrotaxis</i>), although Z.-Y. Yang et al. (2012) found the subfamilial order in the middle of the tree to be [... [Sequoioideae [Athrotaxidoideae [...]]]]. Thus the phylogeny is strongly pectinate basally, although in some morphological analyses two or more members of the first three branches may form a single clade (e.g. Rothwell et al. 2011).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Callitris</i> is paraphyletic, although morphological (Piggin &amp; Bruhl 2010) and molecular (Pye et al. 2003) studies do not agree as to how extensive the paraphyly is. For relationships in <i>Juniperus</i>, see Mao et al. (2010) and Adams and Schwarzbach (2013). <i>Cupressus</i> has turned out to be polyphyletic and is now restricted to the Old World (Xiang &amp; Li 2005; especially Little 2006). Terry and Adams (2015: sampling slight) suggest relationships in this area are [<i>Cupressus</i> [<i>Juniperus</i> [<i>Hesperocyparis</i>, <i>Callitropsis</i>, <i>Xanthocyparis</i>]]], although chloroplast data were a bit wayward.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Having 24 family names for ca 30 genera says a lot about the past. For generic limits around <i>Cupressus</i>, which has turned out to be polyphyletic, see Price and Adams (2009) and Little (2006) and around <i>Callitris</i>, see Pye et al. 2003) and  Piggin and Bruhl (2010). For an account of <i>Cupressus</i>, see Adams (2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Botanical Trivia.</b> <i>Juniperus</i> grows at some 4,900 m altitude on the Tibetan Plateau and forms the highest known forest (Opganoorth et al. 2010). The tallest living tree in the world is a coast redwood <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>, at about 115.5 metres (379 feet), although the giant redwood (<i>Sequoiadendron giganteum</i> is larger and <i>Eucalyptus regnans</i> was almost certainly taller.</p>

<p>Synonymy: <b>Amentotaxaceae</b> Kud&ocirc; &amp; Yamamoto, <b>Austrotaxaceae</b> Nakai, <b>Torreyaceae</b> Nakai</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Taxol and related compounds are synthesized by <i>Taxus</i> and also by several fungi that either grow in the soil around the plant or are endophytes (Cassady et al. 2004 and references), and the fungus may have acquired the ability to synthesize taxol from the plant (Strobel et al. 1996). <i>Pestalotiopsis guepinii</i>, which can synthesize taxol, is also endophytic in <i>Wollemia</i> (Araucariaceae), etc. (Strobel et al. 1997)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> (<i>S</i>)norcolaurine synthase activity is high in both <i>Cephalotaxus</i> and other Taxaceae; this might suggest that benzyisoquinoline alkaoids may be found here (Liscombe et al. 2005). <i>Cephalotaxus</i> contains some very distinctive alkaloids (Parry et al. 1980). There is quite a bit of variation in leaf anatomy, but it does not suggest particular relationships (Ghimire et al. 2014a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For male cones and their similarities, see Mundry and Mundry (2001). Taxaceae s.l. lack sacci on their pollen (Anderson &amp; Owens 2006). The scales subtending the ovules of <i>Austrotaxus</i> are spiral.  <i>Taxus</i> and its immediate relative have female cones with a single ovule and the seed is surrounded by an aril. The sarcotesta of <i>Cephalotaxus</i> has been tentatively equated with the aril of <i>Taxus</i> (Mundry 2000), although the two would not seem to be homologous. A reinterpretation of the female reproductive structures (St&uuml;tzel &amp; R&ouml;wekamp 1999a) suggest that <i>Taxus</i> in particular can be linked with <i>Torreya</i> and then to other conifers; its aril is the equivalent of the sarcotesta of other taxa.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the morphology of <i>Taxus</i> and relatives, see Hart and Price (1990), for male reproductive structures, see Wang et al. (2008), for male gametes, see Chamberlain (1935) and Singh (1978), for the megasporangiate cone, see Andr&eacute; (1956) and Liang and Wang (1989), for embryology in general, see Chen and Wang (1990: the sperm range from somewhat to very unequal in size), and for a general account, see Cope (1998).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Cephalotaxaceae and Taxaceae are combined here because on balance the evidence suggests that the exclusion of <i>Cephalotaxus</i> would make Taxaceae paraphyletic. Page (1990) included <i>Amentotaxus</i> in Cephalotaxaceae, although he noted that affinities between the two were "somewhat enigmatic"; a family as so delimited appears para- or polyphyletic to Taxaceae s. str., c.f. e.g. Price (2003) and Hao et al. (2010). Quinn et al. (2002) in a broad survey of Pinales found that <i>Cephalotaxus</i>, <i>Torreya</i> and relatives, and <i>Taxus</i> and relatives formed a tritomy in their unweighted <i>rbc</i>L and <i>mat</i>K analyses; only when weighted were Cephalotaxaceae and Taxaceae separate. Price (2006) looked at variation in the same two genes and found weak support for <i>Cephalotaxus</i> as sister to [<i>Amentotaxus</i> + <i>Torreya</i>]; sampling overall was poor, but good for Taxaceae s.l., and support for the monophyly of Taxaceae s.l. was strong. These relationships were found by Wang et al. (2003) in analyses of <i>trn</i>L/F singly and when combined with <i>rbc</i>L data, but not in an analysis of <i>rbc</i>L alone, when <i>Cephalotaxus</i> alone was sister to Taxaceae (for the latter relationship, see also Rai et al. 2009). The work of Rai et al. (2008a) also supports a broad circumscription of Taxaceae, as does that of Leslie et al. (2012). Although Hao et al. (2008)  preferred to keep the two families separate, support for this was low; for phylogenies, see also Cheng et al. (2000) and Ghimire and Heo (2014a: morphology only). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Classifications.</b> Cephalotaxaceae and Taxaceae have sometimes been separated (see introduction to Pinales above). <i>Taxus</i> has sometimes been considered quite distinct from all other conifers, the Taxopsida supposedly being well separate from Coniferopsida since pernaps the late Palaeozoic (Florin 1958, also Florin 1949, 1954; Miller 1999).</p>
