(2001) had suggested an age of some (97-)94, 89(-86) m.y., rather like the ca 88.3 m.y. in Naumann et al. (2013), N. Zhang et al. (2012) an age of (90-)81(-70) m.y., Magall&oacute;n and Castillo (2009) an age of around 102 m.y., Bell et al. (2010: note topology) ages of (111-)104, 101(-97) m.y. and Tank et al. (2015: Table S2) an age of  about 113.2 m.y.; somewhat the oldest estimate, at ca 125 m.y., is that of Z. Wu et al. (2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Endress (2011a) suggested that a key innovation around here might be incompletely tenuinucellate ovules.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Endress and Matthews (2006a) noted that an inner integument that is thicker than the outer is common in the COM clade, although this appears not to be the case for Celastrales; this character is not optimised to this part of the tree here, but see within each order. Endress and Matthews (2006a) also note that members of the COM clade commonly have a relatively thin nucellus and arillate seeds.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Similarity in seed coat anatomy had suggested relationships between families now placed in Malpighiales, Celastrales and Oxalidales (and also Zygophyllales) to authors like Corner (1976), Dahlgren (1991) and Boesewinkel (1994). Indeed, a number of Malpighiales, including Linaceae, have a fibrous exotegmen similar to that of Oxalidales. In Celastrales, a similar exotegmen is found in Lepidobotryaceae, but not Celastraceae, given the departure of <i>Perrottetia</i> to Huerteales and <i>Bhesa</i> to Malpighiales (Zhang &amp; Simmons 2006). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> This clade of three orders is often retrieved, e.g. P. Soltis et al. (1999: weak support), Zhang and Simmons (2006), Zhu et al. (2007: mitochondrial <i>mat</i>R gene, but appreciable support only when chloroplast genes added), Hengcheng Wang et al. (2009), Qiu et al. (2010), and M. Sun et al (2016). However, Oxalidales (including Huaceae) are sister to the other two orders in some analyses (e.g. Zhu et al. 2007, but support very weak); support weakened when chloroplast genes were added (see also Soltis et al. 2007a; Bell et al. 2010). Relationships are unclear in Moore et al. (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The COM clade is possibly the result of an ancient hybridization between the fabids and malvids; for further discussion, see the <a href="zygophyllalesweb.htm#rosids" target="home">Zygophyllales</a> page.</p>

Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned

This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain.

close at all in Simmons et al. (2001 - Lepidobotryaceae not included) and were placed sister to Oxalidales with moderate support in Zhang and Simmons (2006; see also Soltis et al. 2011, etc.).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Celastrales were a wildly heterogenous group in the past (see e.g. Lobreau 1965; Cronquist 1981), and any discussion of their limits or relationships involved families scattered throughout Pentapetalae.</p>

<ul><li>Lepidobotryaceae may be recognised by their entire, simple but
articulated leaves with both stipules and stipels. The inflorescence often seems to be opposite the leaves because it is evicted
by the growth of a robust axillary shoot. The flowers are small, with free sepals and petals and ten
basally-connate stamens; the antepetalous stamens have longer filaments than
the antesepalous whorl. The mesocarp,
with its distinctive ladder-like fibres arranged radially, separates from the
horny endocarp. </ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For mycorrhizae, see Bechem et al. (2014). <i>Ruptiliocarpon</i>, at least, has distinctive spirotriterpenoids unique to flowering plants (Asim et al. 2010). There is no evidence other than morphology (articulation, stipels) that the apparently simply leaves are really unifolioliate, and are derived from compound leaves. Dahlgren (1988) suggested that the
vessel elements have scalariform perforation plates, but they are simple; scalariform
pitting is found between vessels and rays. The pits of <i>Ruptiliocarpon</i> are vestured (Mennega 1993).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For information, see Link (1991a: nectaries of <i>Lepidobotrys</i>), Hammel and Zamora (1993: general), Tobe and Hammel (1993: flower and fruit of <i>Ruptiliocarpon</i>), Matthews and Endress (2005b: floral morphology), and Kubitzki (2004b: general), for nodal anatomy of <i>Lepidobotrys</i>,

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Hutchinson (1973) also included <i>Sarcotheca</i>
and <i>Dapania</i> (here in Oxalidaceae) with <i>Lepidobotrys</i>, and the
leaves of <i>Lepidobotrys</i> are indeed superficially like those of
Oxalidaceae, although differing in the stipel and paired stipules. However, the funicular obturator, septicidal
capsule, etc., separates <i>Lepidobotrys</i> from Oxalidaceae; furthermore, the sieve tube
plastids of <i>Lepidobotrys</i> are the common starch type. Cronquist (1981) included <i>Lepidobotrys</i> in Oxalidaceae, and Takhtajan
(1997) placed Leipodoboryaceae and Oxalidaceae alone in his Oxalidales, while suggesting that <i>Ruptiliocarpon</i> - then quite recently described - was rather different, and might even be meliaceous.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The crown-group age of this clade was estimated as (29-)26, 19(-16) m.y. (Wikstr&ouml;m et al. 2001) and (48-)34, 28(-17) m.y. (Bell et al. 2010). </p>

<ul><li><i>Parnassia</i> and <i>Lepuropetalum</i> are herbs that may be recognised by their serrate leaves (<i>Parnassia</i>) that often have reddish lines or dots when dry. The flowers are radially symmetric, petals, when present, are free, there are only five stamens that are opposite the sepals, and the ovary has parietal placentation. There are five staminodes, those of <i>Parnassia</i> being large and particularly distinctive.</ul>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The single, usually rather large flower of <i>Parnassia</i>
is the first flower of a much reduced cyme, and the sessile bract has been
interpreted as a petiolate bract the petiole of which is concaulescent with the
pedicel (Watari 1939). Staminodes
develop later than the stamens, but the androecium is obdiplostemonous. The stamens change their position as they mature, but are initially introrse (Hultg&aring;rd 1987). The floral anatomy of <i>Parnassia</i>
differs from that of Saxifragaceae (Bensel &amp; Palser 1975), where the genus
has often been placed. There are
conflicting reports on testa anatomy. <i>Lepuropetalon</i> is a very small - and poorly known - plant that may lack a corolla and has simple staminodes, the ovary is more or less inferior and the ovules are unitegmic. </p>

<ul><li>The family is vegetatively variable - <i>Microtropis</i>
may have oppposite, entire, exstipulate leaves, while spiral and opposite
leaves on the one plant are not infrequent, as in <i>Catha</i> and <i>Salacia</i>. However, opposite, serrate leaves are common, the stipule-like structures are small and quite often fringed but the nodes are unilacunar; strongly ascending veins
are prominent on dried specimens. Thin,
spiral threads (vessels) are often evident when the lamina is torn transversely, as in Cornaceae. The inflorescences are often cymose, and the
flowers, with their usually very broad disc in which the ovary is more or less
immersed and five or fewer stamens, are often distinctive. The fruit varies greatly, but it is
frequently a loculicidal capsule with winged or arillate seeds. The colleters may turn black, as in <i>Paxistima</i>.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For an evaluation of leaf fossils of Celastraceae by the intuitive method, i.e., not using synapomorphies, see Bacon et al. (02015: p. 369); the oldest accepted, <i>Euonymus</i>, were dated to 59-54 m.y. ago.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Both Salacioideae and Hippocrateoideae may be Old World in origin (Simmons et al. 2009a, b). There are eight separate clades of Celastraceae on Madagascar, the oldest (and largest) being (69.6-)61.7(-53.8) m.y.o., the youngest only around 4.1 m.y.o., indeed, Madagascar may be important in the biogeography of the family, with dispersals from the island in genera like <i>Elaeodendron</i> and <i>Pleurostylia</i> (Bacon et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Potential floral synapomorphies for Celastraceae as presently circumscribed are calcium oxalate druses in floral tissues and ovary characters (Matthews &amp; Endress 2005b; Zhang &amp; Simmons 2006); for morphology in general, see Simmons and Hedin (1999). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Celastraceae  are ecologically one of the more important groups of lianes in the New World (Gentry 1991, as Hippocrateaceae, this old family was made up largely of lianes), with perhaps 360 species involved (Angyalossy et al. 2015; Schnitzer et al. 2015 for additional information).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Seeds of <i>Parnassia</i> are notably small when compared with those of their immediate relatives, and this is possibly associated with the adoption of the herbaceous habit by the genus (Moles et al. 2005a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Some South African Celastraceae have distinctive maytansinoids, ansamycin antibiotics, with a nineteen-member ring (18 C, 1 N), that are likely to be synthesized by the rhizosphere/endophyte actinomycete <i>Actinosynnema pretiosum</i> rather than the plant itself (Pullen et al. 2003; Cassady et al. 2004; Wink 2008: Wings et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The chemistry of the group would repay further study (see Br&uuml;ning &amp; Wagner 1978 for a summary). Celastraceae commonly have yellow triterpene derivatives in their bark, and distinctive triterpenoid quinone methides are quite common, although they have not yet been reported from Parnassioideae or from ex-Stackhousiaceae (Gunatilaka 1996; see also Deepa &amp; Narmatha Bai 2010). Monoamine alkaloids such as cathinone and cathine are potentially quite widely distributed in Celastreae (Simmons et al. 2008) and are the active principal in khat, an infusion made from the leaves of <i>Catha edulis</i>. For the identity and biological activity of secondary metabolites of  <i>Celastrus</i>, see Su et al. (2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The roots of <i>Empleuridium</i> are described as having a superficial cork cambium (Goldblatt et al. 1985). Both <i>Brexia</i> and <i>Parnassia</i>
have leaf traces departing from the center of the stem well below the leaf they
innervate (Cutler &amp; Gregory 1998).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Polycardia</i> has epiphyllous inflorescences.  Savinov (2008) drew the flowers of <i>Stackhousia</i> and <i>Parnassia</i> with the median sepal abaxial. Ex Stackhousiaceae appear to have polysymmetric flowers, but because two stamens are shorter than the others, there is a measure of monosymmetry, too, although I suspect that this is immaterial to the pollinators. A number of taxa have anthers that fall off soon after pollen is dispersed. The filaments are often massive and quite short, and may not be articulated with the anther. Nectary morphology and position - inside or outside of the androecium, vascularized or not, adnate to the gynoecium or not - is notably variable (e.g. Gomes &amp; Lombardi 2013). The flower of <i>Empleuridium</i> has an ovary immersed in the disc and that has been described as being inferior, although it is clearly superior in fruit; its ovule also has an endostomal micropyle (Goldblatt et al. 1985). The inner integument may be thicker than the outer. Variation in fruit and aril is extensive (Simmons et al. 2001), indeed, Zhang et al. (2012, 2014) suggest that a distinctive feature of arils in Celastraceae is that they develop from the exostome - and so might properly be called caruncles (but see also Pfeiffer 1891; Kapil et al. 1980). <i>Salacia</i> has porate pollen; <i>Tripterygium</i> has epitropous ovules. Polyembryony is common in
Celastraceae, the embryos developing from the inner integument. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Celastraceae have turned out to be a somewhat problematic group, and relationships within the family are still very unclear. Some of the initial difficulties encountered in elucidating the phylogeny of the family were because the it was polyphyletic. Thus <i>Bhesa</i> was distinctive in early
morphological analyses (Simmons &amp; Hedin 1999), and is now placed in Malpighiales-Centroplacaceae (Zhang &amp; Simmons 2006) and <i>Goupia</i> in Malvales-Goupiaceae. Matthews and Endress (2005b) found that <i>Perrottetia</i> was rather unlike other members of the family in characters of floral anatomy, however, that genus has found a firm home in Huerteales near <i>Tapiscia</i> (e.g. M. Simmons in Matthews &amp; Endress 2005b; Worberg et al. 2009). Indeed, the inclusion of these three genera (and also <i>Siphonodon</i>) in Celastraceae had previously been considered rather uncertain (Metcalfe &amp; Chalk 1950; Ding Hou 1962; den Hartog &amp; Baas 1978; Matthews &amp; Endress 2005b); <i>Siphonodon</i>, however, is not about to move. <i>Forsellesia</i> has also moved, in this case to Crossosomataceae (Thorne and Scogin (1978). With the removal of these genera, vessels in Celastraceae are predominantly simple, nodal anatomy unilacunar, stipules are minute, indeed, the family became notably less variable morphologically (Zhang &amp; Simmons 2006). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">At the same time Celastraceae have accumulated taxa, that is, some associated families are turning out to be firmly embedded in Celastraceae, and some of the more distinctive groups in Celastraceae as it is currently delimited are briefly characterized at the end of this section.  For studies suggesting a broad circumscription of Celastraceae, see also Soltis and Soltis (1997), Savolainen et al. (1997), Zhang &amp; Simmons 2006; etc. More particularly, Stackhousiaceae were included in
Celastrales by Takhtajan (1997), but they are consistently embedded in Celastraceae in Savolainen
et al. (2000a), Simmons et al. (2000, 2001a, b), Soltis et al. (2007a, but sampling), etc.. Ex-Stackhousiaceae may be sister to a poorly-supported clade including <i>Maytenus</i> (Coughenour et al. 2010, but c.f.  M. Sun et al. 2016: in different major clades). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Simmons et al. (2000) found <i>Parnassia</i> to group with Celastraceae
such as <i>Perrottetia</i> (sic!), although with only moderate support. In Simmons et al.
(2001a) [<i>Quetzalia</i> + <i>Zinowiewia</i>] were sister to other
Celastraceae s. l. (strong support), then [<i>Perrottetia</i> + <i>Mortonia</i>]
were in turn sister to rest of the family (poor support) using <i>PHY</i>B
alone; adding morpholology reversed the position of the two basal clades. Zhang and Simmons (2006) could not resolve the relationships between Celastraceae and Parnassiaceae, the latter group being sister to <i>Mortonia</i> and <i>Pottingeria</i>, with parietal placentation, which formed a poorly supported clade very weakly associated with other Celastraceae; <i>Parnassia</i> was monophyletic (100%) and sister to <i>Lepuropetalum</i> (see also Wikstr&ouml;m et al. 2001; Soltis et al. 2007a, 2011; etc.). Simmons et al. (2012a), in a study focussing on Euonymeae, found that [<i>Parnassia</i> + <i>Lepuropetalum</i>], [Mortonia + <i>Pottingeria</i>] and [<i>Quetzalia</i> + <i>Microtropis</i>] were successively sister to the rest, but support for these positions was not strong, while in Simmons et al. (2012b) the last two clades reversed their positions; where <i>Pottingeria</i> should go is unclear, but that issue aside, <i>Parnassia</i> is sometimes recovered as sister to the rest of the family (Bacon et al. 2015). However, M. Sun et al. (2016) found <i>Mortonia</i> to be sister to the rest of the family, with [<i>Parnassia</i> + <i>Lepuropetalum</i>] and [<i>Zinowiewia</i> [<i>Quetzalia</i> + <i>Microtropis</i>]] together forming a clade (see also Z.-D. Chen et al. 2016: only Chinese genera).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Brexia</i>, another genus that has been segregated as a family, appears to be sister to <i>Empleuridium</i> (Zhang &amp; Simmmons 2006). i>Plagiopteron</i> belongs here; see also Soltis et al. (2007a) who found it was embedded in the family, although sampling was poor.  Simmons et al. (2009a) placed it in Hippocrateoideae, while Coughenour et al. (2010) found that it was sister to a clade including ex Salacioideae and <i>Sarawakodendron</i>. <i>Pottingeria</i>, of the monogeneric Pottingeriaceae, is probably also to be included; it is weakly supported as sister to <i>Mortonia</i> (Zhang &amp; Simmons 2006). The xeromorphic <i>Canotia</i>, sometimes segregated in its own family, is close to <i>Euonymus</i> (Coughenour et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within the old Celastraceae, classical subfamilial limits have not held up at all well. Simmons et al. (2009a) and Coughenour et al. (2010) found that the arillate, capsular <i>Sarawakodendron</i> was sister to Salacioideae, the copious mucilaginous pulp of the berry of that group possibly also being arillate in nature. Sister to this combined group is Hippocrateoideae, with the arillate <i>Helictonema</i> being sister to other taxa (Simmons et al. 2009b; Coughenour et al. 2011). Many Hippocrateoideae have fruits that are deeply trilobed, the lobes being strongly  dorsi-ventrally flattened, the seed wings are basal - although some taxa have a corky testa and the wing is vestigial, and the pollen apertures have an annulus (Coughenour et al. 2010, 2011). Sister to the clade made up of all taxa just mentioned is a largely Old-World clade that includes Lophopetaleae. Seed wings in Lophopetaleae vary in their position relative to the body of the seed. For relationships around <i>Maytenus</i> and <i>Gymnosporia</i>, see McKenna et al. (2011). Cassinoideae and Tripterygioideae have turned out to be very polyphyletic (Simmons et al. 2012b). For a phylogeny of <i>Celastrus</i>, see Mu et al. (2012). For an extensive analysis of relationships in <i>Euonymus</i>, very diverse in S.W. China and within which the more tropical <i>Glyptopetalum</i> is embedded, see Y.-N. Li et al. (2014); sections including taxa with spiny and winged capsules respectively are monophyletic, and for a general study of the family, see Sun et al. (2016).</p>

<ul><li><b>Stackhousiaceae</b>: Plant rhizomatous, &plusmn; herbaceous, sometimes even annual; flowers rather small and with a hypanthium lined
by a nectary; sepals are small, petals clawed, the limbs being connate or not; A 3 + 2 shorter; <u>G [2
(3-5)]</u>, 1 erect ovule/carpel, micropyle exostomal, style or styles +, stigmas elongate, commissural; fruit a dry schizocarp, (winged); exotesta with
tangentially-elongated tanniniferous cells, tegmen absorbed; endosperm +; n =
9, 10, 15.</ul>

<ul><li><b><i>Brexia</i></b>: Plant with dulcitol; leaves conduplicate in bud; disc with stiff processes; ovules bistomal and crassinucellate; integuments multiplicative, exotestal cells tanniniferous, the outer wall thickened and with transverse
thickenings in surface view, exotegmic cells laterally compressed. of the hour-glass type, other cells much thickened. Details of the anatomy  of <i>Brexia</i> (Brexiaceae of some) may be
found in Ramamonjiarisoa (1980), who notes its similarity to that of
Celastraceae; for nodes, see Swamy (1964). Bensel and Palser (1975)  suggested that the androecium
in Brexiaceae is derived from an ancestor that was fasciculate; this is perhaps unlikely. Overall seed coat anatomy of <i>Brexia</i> and
Celastraceae s. str. is similar; ovules are also similar (for the latter, see some details in Mauritzon 1933; also Hils 1985).</ul>


<ul><li><b><i>Plagiopteron</i></b>: Epidermal cells of the lamina crystalliferous; fibres thin-walled,
unlignified, containing elastic material, as in some other Celastraceae
(Takhtajan [1997] described the plant as having latex canals). The pollen has smooth exine, a collared
ectopore and thickened endexine bordering the endopore - rather unlike other
Celastraceae. Other features are also distinctive: indumentum stellate; stomata
anomo- or cyclocytic; lamina margins entire, stipules minute; inflorescence
axillary, paniculate; epicalyx (2-)4(-5), subulate; P (3) 4 (5), valvate, C 0,
A numerous, filaments expanding apically and anthers opening by confluent
apical slits, nectary 0?; <u>G [3]</u>, 2 erect weakly crassinucellate
apotropous ovules/carpel, micropyle zig-zag, endothelium +, style +, stigma
punctate; fruit winged, septicidal; testa?.  See Baas et al. (1979) for a discussion on the nature of the perianth in the genus, Tang
(1994) for its embryology. </ul>

<ul><li><b><i>Canotia</i></b>: Leaves minute, distinctive axillary black-glandular patches; inflorescence fasciculate; 2-6 tenuinucellate ovules/carpel;
fruit an initially septicidal capsule, then carpel units opening adaxially, or
1-seeded drupe; exotesta tanniniferous, thick-walled or not, exotegmen
tracheoidal. Coughenour et al. (2010) suggest that the seeds have aril-derived basal wings (see also <i>Catha</i>). </ul>

<ul><li><b><i>Nicobariodendron</i></b>: Known only from the type. It has mucilage cells, 2-ranked ("opposite" - Simmons 2004) exstipulate leaves, plant dioecious; inflorescence axillary, racemose; flowers  small, staminate flowers with only two stamens borne outside the disc and a central pistillode; fruit a drupe, calyx persistent; seed single, basal (Vasudeva Rao &amp; Chakrabarty 1985). <i>Nicobariodendron</i> is only doubtfully included here by Simmons (2004); I have seen no material and have no idea what it is.</ul>

<ul><li><b><i>Pottingeria</i></b>: Vessel elements with scalariform perforation plates [young stem]; leaves spiral, margins entire, secondary venation
palmate, stipules minute, cauline; inflorescence fasciculate; flowers small, K
and C free, borne near the outside and on undersurface of a
large disc; <u>G [3]</u>, placentation intrusive parietal,
many ovules/carpel, style +, short, branches relatively long,
spreading; fruit a septicidal capsule; A and placental bundles persistent;
mesotesta fibrous; endosperm copious; n = ? No characters obviously link <i>Pottingeria</i>
with any other group, although it is not obviously very different from Celastraceae. Indeed, <i>Pottingeria</i> was placed in Celastraceae subfamily
Pottingerioideae by Airy Shaw (in Airy Shaw et al. 1973), and this is consistent both with
nodal and testa anatomy.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For a reworking of the classification of Celastraceae, we await the conclusion of  Mark Simmons's careful march through the family. If [<i>Parnassia</i> + <i>Lepuropetalum</i>] do turn out to be sister to all other Celastraceae, it would be best to recognise two families; although Zhang and Simmons (2006) could not resolve the relationships between Celastraceae and Parnassiaceae, they elected to keep the two families provisionally separate. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For generic limits, see Islam et al. (2006), Simmons et al. (2008), and McKenna et al. (2011: the <i>Maytenus</i> and <i>Gymnosporia</i> areas); there are generic problems in Hippocrateoideae (Simmons et al. 2009b) and Salacioideae (Coughenour et al. 2010).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> <i>Plagiopteron</i> was included in
Flacourtiaceae by Sleumer (1961) and placed in Malvales by Takhtajan (1997). <i>Brexia</i> was included in
Hydrangeaceae by Cronquist (1981), but was placed near Celastraceae by Takhtajan
(1997). Stackhousiaceae were placed in in Celastrales by both Cronquist (1981) and Takhtajan (1997). Pottingeriaceae were included
in Hydrangeales by Takhtajan (1997), who described the stamens as being adnate to the
extrastaminal disc, but there is no evidence for such a position. Hippocrateaceae, with A often fewer than C, borne inside/on top of the disc, anthers usu.
transversely dehiscent, aril 0, endosperm 0, have often been separated from Celastraceae, but are clearly embedded within them (see above).</p>
