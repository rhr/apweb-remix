(2012) suggested ages of a mere 68.6 or 62.2 m.y. for this clade and Hohmann et al. (2015) an age of 109.1 m.y., although in all the internal topologies are different from that used here. (100.2-)94.6, 70.6(-61.6) are ages suggested by Pfeil and Crisp (2008) and around 96.8 or 86.3 m.y. is suggested by Naumann et al. (2013); by far the oldest estimate, at ca 132 m.y., is that of Z. Wu et al. (2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b>  <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> See D. W. Taylor et al. (2012) for possible apomorphies of the whole clade.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Nitrogen fixation in this group of four orders is a classic example of a "tendency" or "predisposition" (e.g. Soltis et al. 1995b; Kistner &amp; Parniske 2002; Vessey et al. 2004; Marazzi et al. 2012); Werner et al. (2014) introduced a different set of terms, but the principle is the same. The molecular reasons for the restriction of these diverse bacterial associations to the N-fixing clade are being dissected. A number of the genes involved in the establishment of the symbioses with both  gram-negative &alpha; and &beta; proteobacteria including <i>Rhizobium</i> and the gram-positive actinomycete <i>Frankia</i>  are the same as those involved in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations, the "SYM" (symbiosis) pathway being involved in all (Markmann &amp; Parniske 2008; Bonfante &amp; Genre 2010; Hocher et al. 2011; J. J. Doyle 2011; Svistoonoff et al. 2013).  There are connections between the signalling genes involved in AM symbioses and rhizobial Nod factors that allow the bacterium to be recognised by the plant (Maillet et al. 2010; Op den Camp et al. 2010; Streng et al. 2011; Young et al. 2011; Roberts et al. 2012), and the rhizobia may acquire the <i>nod</i> genes by horizontal transfer within Fabaceae (Suominen et al. 2001). Both the AM establishment and nodulation pathways involve the recognition of lipochitooligosaccharides (N-acetylglucosamine units - see chitin - with a fatty acid at one end and 2-O-methyfucose at the other), part of the common symbiosis signalling pathway (CSSP), and nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations ("spiking") occur in both (Garcia et al. 2015; Kawaharada et al. 2017). The CSSP may be involved in the establishment of actinorhizal associations, with nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in both (Barker et al. 2017). There are further connections to pathogen resistance, which involves chitooligosaccharides (Liang et al. 2014); for oomycete resistance and AM absence, see Delaux et al. (2014). Other flowering plants respond to the rhizobial Nod factor by suppressing MAMP (microbe-associated molecular pattern) immunity - and this is the initial response even in rhizobial infection in legumes (Liang et al. 2013). Interestingly, Nod factors are not found in many actinorhizal associations (Normand et al. 2007) and even the legume <i>Aeschynomene</i> may not need them (Giraud et al. 2007). It appears that (see also A. Taylor &amp; Qiu 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The symbiosis receptor-like kinase gene exists in a particularly distinctive form in the N-fixing clade - and also in <i>Tropaeolum</i>, but not rice, tomato or poppy. This gene in the three latter genera rescued mycorrhizal formation in defective forms of the gene in Fabaceae, but not nodule formation, whereas the <i>Tropaeolum</i> gene restored the ability to form nodules (Markmann et al. 2008; see also Chen et al. 2007, 2009; Gherbi et al. 2008; Yano et al. 2008; Markmann &amp; Parniske 2009). There is notable similarity at the transcriptional level in the genes involved in the establishment of N-fixing endosymbioses in <i>Casuarina</i>, <i>Alnus</i>, Rhamnaceae (all with actinorhiza), legumes, etc. (Hocher et al. 2011), and many of these genes have been coopted from other pathways that are widely functional in land plants, including hornworts and liverworts (Svistoonoff et al. 2013). Werner et al. (2014) suggested that a state precursory to nitrogen fixation was necessary, and that this had been lost 16< times, however, this idea seems to be somewhat notional, although testable.</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Members of the  nitrogen-fixing clade, practically alone among land plants, have associations with N-fixing bacteria - there have been some nine independent establishments of symbioses with <i>Frankia</i> alone (H.-L. Li et al. 2015: three chloroplast genes, very good sampling), and at least eight more with the proteobacteria, particularly rhizobia, most in Fabaceae  (e.g. Swensen 1996; Clawson et al. 2004; J. J. Doyle 2011; Santi et al. 2013; Werner et al. 2014: c.f. topology; J. J. Doyle 2016).</p>
 
 
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A final wrinkle is the possibility of an ancient hybridization involving the N-fixing clade and the malvids, the COM clade being the result, but since much of the nuclear genome of the COM clade seems to be malvid in origin, N-fixing in the COM clade would not be expected (Sun et al. 2015; see also discussion under the <a href="zygophyllalesweb.htm#rosids" target="home">rosid</a> clade). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><a name=Fabsecphys><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u></a> H.-L. Li et al. (2015: n.b. stem-group ages for N-fixing clades - they are sometimes very stemmy!) suggested that associations with <i>Frankia</i> were established during two periods in the Late Cretaceous and Eocene when both global temperatures and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were high; by their estimates, no new <i>Frankia</i> relationships have been established since the beginning of the Oligocene. The ability to fix N has evolved several times in Fabaceae, and is certainly not an apomorphy for the family; ages when N fixation became established are </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Nitrogen-fixing members of this clades grow in both tropical and temperate regions of the world and are very important in the global N cycle, moving N from the atmosphere into biological cycles; denitrifying bacteria accomplish the reverse. Thus over 100 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> can be added to the system (Carlsson &amp; Huss-Danell 2003 and references), similarly, estimates of biological N fixation in terrestrial environments, much of which is by bacteria associated with Fabaceae, are 90% of the 100-140 Tg [= 1012g) of the total N fixed per annum (Gage 2004 and references).  Once N has entered biological cycles, the activities of <i>Metarhizium</i> and related ascomycete fungi in moving N from insects eating plants back to plants should be taken into account; they may be another important element in the global N cycle (Behie &amp; Bidochka 2014), along with nitrogen fixation in thunderstorms and denitrification in the soil.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Nitrogen-fixing plants are usually not members of closed lowland tropical rainforest communities, often growing in more open vegetation, even in early successional communities. <i>Frankia</i>-associated plants are woody, and favour high light and soils with low available N, and are early successional for the most part (H.-L. Li et al. 2015). There are major geographic patterns in the kinds of N fixation. Thus <i>Frankia</i> associations are generally obligate and are commoner in cooler areas of the globe,  while rhizobial N fixation in Fabaceae is generally facultative and N-fixing fabaceous trees are uncommon north of 35<sup>o</sup>N; the costs of constructing, maintaining and regulating the N-fixing pathway interact with temperature and the obligate/facultative difference (Menge et al. 2014). Such ecological rather than evolutionary constraints may be the limiting factors in the distribution of N fixation (Menge &amp; Crews 2016). Interestingly, bacteria related to <i>Rhizobium</i>, but which do not fix N, dominate in coniferous forests where N fixing plants are vanishingly uncommon (VanInseberghe et al. (2015). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">N-fixing plants in general - although Fabaceae make up the majority of these - have very high concentrations of nitrogen in the leaf, and high leaf nitrogen has been linked with high levels of both carbon fixation and photosynthesis (see M. Adams et al. 2016). However, Adams et al. (2016) did not confirm these correlations, rather, water use efficiency was linked with  leaf nitrogen in woody nitrogen-fixing plants. There is no evidence that Fabaceae in general have a high demand for nitrogen, moreover, inoculation of plants with crushed rhizobia affected plamt nitrogen concentrations independently of any fixation, which suggests a rather complex interaction between the plant and bacterium (Wolf et al. 2016). Haemoglobin is intimately involved in helping preserve the largely oxygen-free micro-environment the bacteria need for nitrogen fixation - nitrogenase is inactivated by oxygen; a variety of haemoglobins are involved, including haemoglobin synthesized by <i>Frankia</i> (Vessey et al. 2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The ability to fix nitrogen is uncommon elsewhere in seed plants, although nitrogen-fixing  blue-green algae are associated with Gunneraceae and Cycadales. <i>In vitro</i> nitrogen fixation by <i>Azotobacteria vinelandii</i> endophytic in <i>Mammillaria</i> has been recorded (Lopez et al. 2011), and <i>Burkholderia</i>, a genus which can fix nitrogen in Fabaceae, forms associations in leaf nodules with some <a href="ericalesweb.htm#Myrsinaceae" target="home">Primulaceae-Myrsinoideae</a> and  <a href="gentianalesweb.htm#Rubiaceae" target="home">Rubiaceae</a>, and may even fix nitrogen in sugar cane (de Carvalho et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Species forming ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations are also common in the N-fixing clade, and this association has evolved here at least seven times (and also in other seed plants), but apparently not in Cucurbitales. Plants with ECM fungi rarely fix nitrogen, although Casuarinaceae are an exception. Interestingly, ECM associations also involve a perturbation of the nitrogen cycle in that nitrogen may move directly from humus to the fungus, and then to the plant, rather than moving in inorganic form from the soil into the root hairs (see also <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#EctomycorrhizalPlants" target="home">below</a>).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> There are associations of particular groups of butterflies and plants (as food sources for caterpillars) within Fabales
and Rosales in particular (Ackery 1988, 1991). Indeed, it has been suggested, as by Scott (1985) and Janz and Nylin (1998; see also Braby &amp; Trueman 2006) that the ancestral food plant for larvae of butterflies as a whole may perhaps have been somewhere in the N-ixing clade or the malvids or their  (immediate) ancestors (Nylin et al. 2014), however, caterpillars are common in the latter only on Fabaceae, a fairly young, mostly Caenozoic group (see below); stem Fabales are rather older (see above). Malvales are another possibility (Ackery 1991), as are Rosids as a whole (e.g. Powell 1980; Berenbaum &amp; Passoa 1999).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Jeong et al. (1999) and Clawson et al. (2004) compared  phylogenetic relationships within <i>Frankia</i> with those of its hosts. Clawson et al. (2004) suggested that all three clades of <i>Frankia</i> that they recognised might have diverged before the evolution of the angiosperms, while Jeong et al. (1999) thought that the <i>Frankia</i> clades had diverged after the plant clades, being about one third the ages of the latter. However, their plant ages were extraordinarily old, thus the [Rosales [Fagales + Cucurbitales]] clade was estimated to be 429-199 m.y.o. (Jeong et al. 1999). Using age estimates of Bell et al. (2010), J. J. Doyle noted that the common ancestor of the N-fixing clade was about 100 m.y.o., but the first symbiosis in extant clades was likely to be at most ca 70 m.y.a. - a 30 m.y. lag. Particularly old N-fixing clades may be Datiscaceae and Elaeagnaceae, but since both have very long stems exactly when N-fixing actually evolved there is anyone's guess. For the considerable gene/genome divergence within <i>Frankia</i>, see Normand et al. (2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Intercellular penetration of the root epidermis by <i>Frankia</i> may be the plesiomorphic route of infection, occurring in both Rosales and perhaps in Cucurbitales; in Fagales infection is through root hairs (Clawson et al. 2004; c.f. Santi et al. 2013). However, given the absence of strong phylogenetic structure in the group, details of how infection patterns map on to phylogeny are unclear (see also Soltis et al. 2005a; J. J. Doyle 2011).   The situation is made more complicated because of the diversity of bacteria that have "independently" (but see <a href="fabalesweb.htm#Fabaceae" target="home">below</a>: gene casettes, symbiosis islands, etc.) become involved in nitrogen fixation in Fabaceae alone. Thus in <i>Mimosa</i> and some Fabaceae-Faboideae, at least, &szlig;-proteobacteria like <i>Burkholderia phymatum</i> and <i>Cupriavidus</i> form nodules that fix nitrogen. The &alpha;-proteobacteria, rhizobia, that form nodules in other Fabaceae occur in four separate clades, over a dozen "species" being involved (J. J. Doyle 1998; Moulin et al. 2001; Sprent 2002; Elliott et al. 2007; Bontemps et al. 2010; Sprent et al. 2013).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although there is considerable variation in nodule morphology, this does not correlate with bacterium type. In general in Fabaceae the nodules arise from the cortex and have peripheral vascular tissue with bacterial infected cells in the center; they are perhaps shoot-like structures (Hirsch &amp; Larue 1997; Franche et al. 1998; Couzigou et al.  2012). All other nodules, whether associated with <i>Frankia</i> or rhizobia, are modified lateral roots, although they lack a root cap - the vascular tissue is central, initiation of the nodule is pericyclic, and it is the cortical cells that contain bacteria (Gualtieri &amp; Bisseling 2000; Raven &amp; Edwards 2001; Vessey et al. 2004). However, recent work shows that nodule origination in Faboideae occurs where lateral roots develop, although cortical cells may also be involved (op den Camp et al. 2011). Indeed, in nodule development in Faboideae there seems to have been co-option of genes originally involved in lateral root origination after a genome duplication event ca 54 m.y.a. (op den Camp et al. 2011; J. J. Doyle 2011).  N-fixing clades such as <i>Chamaecrista</i> lack this duplication, although they may have another (Cannon et al. 2010, 2014), and overall any causal connection between duplication and nodulation is unclear (Cannon et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations are also common in the N-fixing clade, for instance, in Fabaceae-Detarioideae and Fagales, and ECM associations have been reported from a number of taxa which  harbour <i>Frankia</i> (e.g. Rose 1980).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Whether or not the presence of stipules is plesiomorphic in the clade depends in part on its phylogeny, but there is clearly a variety of structures borne at the node - and nodal anatomy is also variable (see below: de Aguiar-Dias et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For the limits of the N-fixing clade, a rather unexpected group, see Chase et al.
(1993, 1999), Savolainen et al. (1997), Soltis et al. (1995b, 1997, 1998), and
Swensen (1996). Although it was not recovered by some analyses of the complete chloroplast genome (Bausher et al. 2006), the poor sampling - no other fabids/rosid I taxa were included - may well be reponsible; the nitrogen-fixing clade was also found not to be monophyletic in Duarte et al. (2010) or in the genome-level analysis of Burleigh et al. (2011). The clade had little support in the mitochondrial <i>mat</i>R analysis of Zhu et al. (2007), but support was much strengthened when two chloroplast genes were added; it was also monophyletic in the mitochondrial analysis of Qiu et al. (2010; see also Z.-D. Chen et al. 2016). For further discussion of the relationships of the N-fixing clade, an ancestor of which was possibly involved in an ancient hybridization with the malvids, see the <a href="zygophyllalesweb.htm#rosids" target="home">Zygophyllales</a> page, however,  much of the nuclear genome of the COM clade, the possible product of this hybridization, seems to be malvid in origin.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Relationships within the clade are still somewhat unclear (e.g. Qiu et al. 2010; Xue et al. 2012). Although Zhu et al. (2007) could not even recover a monophyletic Rosales using the mitochondrial <i>mat</i>R gene, the other three orders were, however, all strongly supported, and in most other analyses all orders are well supported. Sytsma et al. (2002)  recovered a topology [Cucurbitales [Fabales [Fagales + Rosales]]], while in Zhu et al. (2007: four genes) and Lee et al (2011: focus on nuclear genome) relationships were [Fab [C [Fag + R]]], albeit there was little support for the topologies found (see also Bell et al. 20100. However, Ravi et al. (2007) examining data sets including 61 protein-coding genes (for only three orders) and just four genes (Fagales included) found good support for [Fab + R] and some support for the broader grouping [C [Fag [Fab + R]]]. However, apart from Fabales (three Fabaceae-Faboideae included), the other orders were represented by single exemplars. A [Fab + R] clade was also obtained by Jansen et al. (2007) and Moore et al. (2007), but no Fagales were included. In other analyses there is some support for a [C + Fag] clade (see Chase et al. 1993; Setoguchi et al. 1999; Schwarzbach &amp; Ricklefs 2000; Soltis et al. 2000, 2003a; Zhang et al. 2006). However, the support for the topology in the Summary Tree is quite strong (Jeong et al. 1999: no Fabaceae included; Moore et al. 2008, 2011; H. Wang et al. 2009; Soltis et al. 2011; Z. Wu et al. 2014; Foster et al. 2016a: support weak), but confirmation after e.g. increased taxon sampling would be comforting. Indeed, H.-L. Li et al. (2015) recovered the relationships [Fab [R [C + Fag]]] with very good generic sampling while L. Zhao (2016) found strong support for the topology [[Fab  + Fag] [R + C]] in a large-scale nuclear gene analysis, although there of course sampling was rather exiguous.</p>

Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).</p>



	
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Fabales contain ca 9.6% eudicot diversity (Magall&oacute;n et al. 1999), of which the bulk is made up of Fabaceae. If [Quillajaceae + Surianaceae] are sister to Fabaceae, then a strong slow-down in the rate of evolution occurred in the former clade, although if <i>Duparquetia</i> is sister to the rest of Fabaceae, things get more complicated. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bello et al. (2012) suggested a number of apomorphies for Fabales; <i>Krameria</i> was used as the outgroup because people in the past had suggested similarities between it and Polygalaceae, so most of the apomorphies listed are likely to be plesiomorphies. Despite the floral differences between Polygalaceae and Fabaceae, there are some developmental similarities between them (Prenner 2004d), however, the keel flowers in the two may have arisen independently (Bello et al. 2012). Indeeed, given the uncertainty over the relationships between the four families, optimisation of characters is a particularly fraught enterprise here.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> About a quarter of all records of extra-floral nectaries come from members of this clade (Weber &amp; Keeler 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The distribution of a number of features may be of systematic significance in Fabales, but sampling is poor. Variation in nodal
anatomy within Surianaceae is correlated with presence/absence of stipules. Although styloids, along with druses, are reported from Surianaceae, Quillajaceae and Fabaceae, details of their distribution within Fabaceae are unclear; they are certainly quite common in Faboideae (Lersten &amp; Horner 2005), apparently less so in the rest of the family. The <i>rpl</i>22 gene is in the nucleus in Polygalaceae and Fabaceae (i.e. it is absent from the chloroplast), but other members of the order have not been studied and its presence in other angiosperms is sporadic (J. J. Doyle et al. 1995; Su et al. 2014; Dugas et al. 2015). Pollen grains of Quillajaceae and some Surianaceae have exine protruding at the apertures, and these and some Fabaceae-Cercidoideae (although perhaps derived within that group?) have striate pollen (Banks et al. 2003; Claxton et al. 2005); these features are unlikely to be high-level apomorphies. It would be nice to know if Surianaceae
or Quillajaceae had starchy endosperm, and more details of their chemistry are
needed. Many Fabaceae-Faboideae have lost the <i>rps</i>16 gene, and it is also absent from <i>Polygala</i> (Downie &amp; Palmer 1992: again, sampling).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Fabales as circumscribed here were rather unexpected, but they are quite strongly supported (Morgan et al. 1994; K&auml;llersj&ouml; et al. 1998; etc.). Although Hilu et al. (2003) found <i>Larrea</i> (Zygophyllaceae) to be weakly associated with Fabaceae, the latter were the only Fabales included in their <i>rbc</i>L analysis.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Fabales, Persson (2001) suggested the relationships [<u>P</u>olygalaceae [<u>S</u>urianaceae [<u>Q</u>uillajaceae + <u>F</u>abaceae]]], but with little support (this tree was used in versions 1-6 of this site), although elements of it were recently obtained by Cannon et al. (2014: Surianaceae not sampled) and Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016: Quillajaceae not sampled). Forest et al. (2002, see also Qiu et al. 2010) found weak support for the topology of the tree below, and Banks et al. (2008) also found strong support for the relationship [Q [the rest]]. However, Wojciechowski et al. (2004: ?sampling) suggested the possibility of a [S + Q] grouping. The unrooted topology in Bruneau et al. (2008a) is [P [Q + S] F]. Bello et al. (2009) in a careful analysis of <i>mat</i>K and <i>rbc</i>L data, preferred the relationships [P [F [S + Q]]] obtained in a maximum parsimony analysis, however, support was poor, and if anything was still poorer for any relationships obtained in Bayesian analyses of the same data (see also  M. Sun et al. 2016). Wang et al. (2009) did not obtain well supported relationships in Fabales in their twelve-gene analysis of the rosids, while in a megaphylogeny of angiosperms Smith et al. (2011) found some support for a clade [Q + F]. Relationships remained unclear in the study by Soltis et al. (2011). Bello returned to the problem and included morphological data with a two-gene data set. In various analyses [S + Q] were usually at least moderately supported, but support for Fabaceae and Polygalaceae as being successively sister to that pair was weak (Bello et al. 2012); the topology recovered by Bello et al. was also preferred by Cardoso et al. (2013b) and Koenen et al. (2013), although they focussed on Fabaceae. Cardoso et al. (2013b) also placed <i>Vauquelina</i> (Rosaceae!) in this area as part of a tritomy. That genus has indeed been associated with <i>Quillaja</i> in the past, but some time ago in an ITS phylogeny it grouped with <i>Rhaphiolepis</i> and <i>Eriobotrya</i> within Rosaceae-Amgydaloideae (Campbell et al. 1995). H.-L. Li et al. (2015, 2016) obtained the groupings [[S + Q] [P + F]], although support for the latter family pair was not good, and L. Zhao (2016: Surianaceae not included) found the relationships [Q [P + F]]. The bottom line: The topology of the tree used here may be wrong - a [S + Q] clade is quite often recovered!</p>

<ul><li>Quillajaceae are vegetatively rather undistinguished with their spiral, serrate, stipulate leaves, although the conspicuous but rather distant teeth appear to be hydathodal. They may be readily recognised by their distinctive widely-open flowers in which the antesepalous stamens are borne on the outer edge of the conspicuous yellow disc some way up the sepals and the antepetalous stamens are borne inside the nectary near the base of the ovary.  The petals are clawed and the strongly lobed fruits open down both the inner and outer surfaces of the lobes and contain winged seeds.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> There is a genome duplication here (Cannon et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The leaves are amphistomatous. The flowers of Quillajaceae, with the distinctive arrangement of nectary and androecium, may be interpreted as having a hypanthium. Androecial development is unidirectional and is rather like that of Fabaceae (Bello et al. 2007/8); the carpels are definitely connate axially, but are largely free laterally, c.f. earlier versions of this site. There appear to be only three traces to each carpel, although Sterling (1969) noted that there were also "intermediate" bundles. Robertson (1974) noted that n = 17. Embryologically the family is poorly known. </p>

Rosaceae-Quillajoideae (Takhtajan 1997) or, more usually, in
Spiraeaoideae, e.g. as Quillajeae (Robertson 1974). It is indeed superficially quite similar to the South American <i>Kageneckia</i> (Spiraeaoideae), but wood anatomical data, etc.,
suggest that it should be removed from Rosaceae (Lotova &amp; Timonin 1999; c.f. Zhang 1992). </p>

<ul><li>Fabaceae may be recognised by their compound, stipulate
leaves whose leaflets are entire and often have wrinkled pulvini, and flowers with a single
carpel, free petals (or two may be connate), and stamens either all similar in
length, or if dissimilar, not regularly alternating longer and shorter. The fruit is usually dry and elongated, the often flattened seeds being borne in a single rank.</ul>

<ul><li>&quot;Caesalpinioideae&quot; and Cercidoideae are woody plants that may be
recognised by their usually once-compound leaves and monosymmetric flowers with
the odd petal adaxial and inside the others in bud; the hypanthium is often
well-developed. </p>

<p>Floral formula:  &uarr;  <font style="text-decoration: overline;"</font>K 5; C 5; A</font> 10; N; <u>G 1</u>.</ul></li>


<ul><li>The mimosoid clade is also made up of mostly woody plants that have leaves that are often
bicompound and with extrafloral nectaries on the petiole and/or rhachis. The flowers are rather small and are often borne in heads, all flowers
opening more or less simultaneously; the long, coloured filaments form the visually attractive part of the inflorescence. Both the calyx and corolla are valvate, and both (and often the bases of
the filaments) are connate. The seeds
have a fine, U-shaped line on both sides. <p>

<p>Floral formula: * K [5]; C [5]; A 10-many/[10-many]; N; <u>G 1</u>.</ul></li>

<ul><li>Faboideae are usually herbs or vines and often have
once-compound leaves. The flowers are
monosymmetric with the odd petal being adaxial and outside the others; the
papilionoid flower consists of adaxial banner, paired wings and two connate
petals forming the keel. The stamens
have more or less connate filaments and the fruit is often explosively dehiscent, simultaneously splitting down both sides and the two valves  twisting.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For the fossil record of Fabaceae, see Herendeen and Dilcher (1992).  For fossils of <i>Cercis</i>, see Jia and Manchester (2014); the oldest, from Oregon, date from about 26 m.y. ago.  Bruneau et al. (2008a, b) thought that the major clades in Fabaceae had separated by 58-55 m.y.a.; the crown ages of the major clades are 56-34 m.y., but note that constrained (given above) and unconstrained ages differed considerably, the latter sometimes being one seventh of the former (Bruneau et al. (2008a). Numerous ages for nodes throughout the family are given by Lavin et al. (2005), and Koenen et al. (2013). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fabaceae are a notably speciose clade, particularly the Caesalpinioideae (esp. the mimosoid clade) and Faboideae (esp.  the inverted reapeat loss clade) (Magall&oacute;n &amp; Sanderson 2001), and contain ca 9.4% of eudicots. Koenen et al. (2013) note that by practically any measure of success, Fabaceae are successful - which is pretty much a fair statement, as we shall see. In general, the great diversity of the family can be explained by number of separate radiations rather than any great One Thing. Thus even the very speciose <i>Astragalus</i> is not particularly notably so when considered in the context of its immediate relatives (Sanderson &amp; Wojciechoswki 1996).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Floral morphology and development is particularly variable in Fabaceae, and the numerous papers by Shirley Tucker are an essential starting point for any understanding here  (e.g. Tucker 1987, 1989, 2003a; Tucker &amp; Douglas 1994: phylogeny, for more general accounts). Clarifying basal relationships in the family will be particularly important. Mirror image flowers are scattered in non-mimosoid Fabaceae (Tucker 1996b). Details of hypanthial evolution within Fabaceae are unclear; it seems to have become much reduced and lost several times.  The "normal" (for flowering plants) floral orientation of
the mimosoid clade with the median sepal adaxial and the median petal abaxial is secondary; in some 4-merous members of the mimosoid clade the median petal is adaxial (Prenner 2011). Although the normal orientation is also found in Caesalpininioideae like <i>Ceratonia</i>, the inverted orientation occurs in Cercidoideae (see Tucker 1989; Herendeen et al. 2003; Luckow et al. 2005), <i>Duparquetia</i>, many Caesalpinioideae, and Faboideae. <i>Duparquetia</i>, near basal in the family, has highly derived flowers, while in the Faboideae there are a number of near basal clades that include taxa with polysymmetric flowers and numwerous stamens and taxa with papilionoid flowers (e.g.  Cardoso 2012a, b), and near-basal in the 50 kb inversion clade is <i>Aldina</i>, with polysymmetric flowers, sister to [<i>Andira</i> + <i>Hymenolobium</i>], with papilionoid flowers (Ramos et al. 2015), suggesting an early "experimental phase" in the evolution of floral morphologies in the family (Prenner &amp; Klitgaard 2008; Ramos et al. 2015). Although over half the species in the family are in the NPAAA clade (mostly papilionoid flowers) and the mimosoid clade (brush flowers), both these clades are deeply embedded in the phylogeny, and for the great diversity of floral morphology in other parts of the family, the images in L.P.W.G. (2017) are a good introduction.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Diversification and distribution of Fabaceae can be thought of in terms of vicariance of biomes rather than of classic geographical areas (Lavin et al. 2004; Schrire et al. 2005). Indeed, a Gondwanan age for Amherstieae (= Detarioideae), and so a proportionally older age for the family as a whole, suggested because of their amphiatlantic distribution and common possession of ectomycorrhizae (Henkel et al. 2002), seems unlikely. Changes in diversification rates of clades can quite frequently be linked to biome shifts (Koenen et al. 2013). Fabaceae, many of which are deciduous, are very important components of the vegetation  of seasonally dry tropical forests (= the succulent biome) and savannas  (Oliveira-Filho et al. 2013; see also Pennington &amp; Lavin 2016: stem ages of species tend to be old in such habitats), indeed, in the neotropics species diversity of Fabaceae is correlated with temperature (Punyasena et al. 2008). There are a number of transoceanic disjunctions within the family, and 51/59 of those listed by Schrire et al. (2005) are only 1-22 m.y. old (see also Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. 2010b; Vatanparast et al. 2013: <i>Dalbergia</i>); the North Atlantic land bridge may have been important in the Caenozoic dispersal of the family (Lavin et al. 2000). One particularly interesting connection is in <i>Hymenaea</i>, whose resin forms valuable amber deposits. The majority of the species are New World, but there is a single Old World species, <i>H. verrucosa</i>. Both the Mexican and Dominican ambers seems to have been produced by extinct species whose immediate relationships are likely to be with <i>H. verrucosa</i> (Poinar &amp; Brown 2002). Schaefer et al. (2012) estimated that there had been as many as 7 long distance dispersal events per 10 million years in Fabeae.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Diversification in <i>Cercis</i> began ca 35 m.y.a. and spread was from east to west - and across the Atlantic (Fritsch &amp; Cruz 2012). Cercidoideae may be Tethyan in origin, initially favouring seasonally dry habitat (Sinou et al. 2009, c.f. Meng et al. 2014, but sampling exiguous, note dates).  Marazzi and Sanderson (2010) suggest an age of 53-47.5 m.y. for stem group <i>Senna</i>, (47-)45(-41.7) m.y. for the speciose crown group. Early divergence within the mimosoid clade seems to have occurred in Africa (Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. 2010b). The age of the crown-group clade [Ingeae + Acacieae] is estimated at (24.5-)21(-17.2) m.y. by de Souza et al (2013), q.v. for other dates in the <i>Calliandra</i> area. <i>Inga</i>, with some 350 species, has diversified in the New World LTRF that it prefers only within the last 2 m.y. (Richardson et al. 2001b; Pennington et al. 2009; Dexter et al. 2010: thoughts on species limits; see also Iganci et al. 2015 for <i>Abarema</i>); it and the detarioid <i>Tachigali</i>, also quite diverse there, have notably short generation times (Baker et al. 2014). Up to 43 species of <i>Inga</i> may coexist at a single site, and this may in part be possible because species, even sister species, differ considerably in antiherbivore defences (Kursar et al. 2009; Endara et al. 2015; see also Richardson et al. 2001b; Pennington et al. 2009; Sedio et al. 2017). For diversification in <i>Mimosa</i>, a two-step affair, see Koenen et al. (2013). Estimates of the age of crown-group <i>Acacia</i>, some 1,000+ species, range from 26.6-3.3 m.y.a., the older age being driven by recent fossil discoveries (Miller et al. 2013, q.v. for dates of the other ex <i>Acacia</i> genera, etc.). Gonz&aacute;lez-Orozco et al. (2013) plotted the distribution of Australian <i>Acacia</i> (practically the whole genus) in the context of various environmental factors, and they thought that climatic variables were correlated with the largest-scale patterns; Mishler et al. (2014) looked at patterns of endemism taking into account endemism and age of clades, and found areas of palaeoendemism scattered in the continent, with neoendemism particularly apparent in soutwestern Australia in particular. The very close similarity between <i>A. koa</i>, from Hawaii, and <i>A. heterophylla</i>, from R&eacute;union Island and some 18,000 km distant, is surprising. It has been explained by movement by Austronesians of a species like <i>A. melanoxylon</i> from eastern Australia (Brown et al. 2012). However, given the structure of relationships - <i>A. heterophylla</i> is embedded in <i>A. koa</i>, the combined clade being sister to <i>A. melanoxylon</i> - long distance dispersal from Hawii to R&eacute;union, implausible although it may seem, is more likely (Le Roux et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Extrafloral nectaries are common in Fabaceae. They characterise a major clade within South American <i>Senna</i>, where they may be a "key innovation" that is involved in the diversification of that clade, much more speciose than its sister clade (68 species lacking nectaries versus 282 species with nectaries) and it has also speciated significantly faster. The extrafloral nectary-bearing clade may have moved in to new habitats that became available after the Andean uplift and speciated there (Marazzi et al. 2006, 2013b; Marazzi &amp; Sanderson 2008, esp. 2010; Weber &amp; Agrawal 2014). Marazzi and Sanderson (2010) suggest a crown-group age for this clade of some 40.8-30.6 m.y., that is, somewhat before the Andean uplift (ca 30 m.y.a.). But Marazzi and Sanderson (2010) also noted that Simon (2008) had found that the <u>loss</u> of extra-floral nectaries characterized a large clade of <i>Mimosa</i> that was far more speciose than its sister clade; the ratio of species in the sister taxa with and without extrafloral nectaries there is 15:515 (Simon et al. 2011). Furthermore, a less conspicuous and organized kind of extrafloral nectary characterizes a separate clade of <i>Senna</i> (Marazzi et al. 2013b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Of the ca 116 genera of Faboideae in clades below the non-protein amino acid accumulating (NPAAA) clade, most (ca 70%) are small, with 10 or fewer species. However, floral morphology there is very diverse, many genera having other than papilionoid flowers (Cardoso et al. 2013a, b, 2015). Shoemaker et al. (2006) and Soltis et al. (2009) think, although with some hesitation, that diversification in Faboideae may be connected to a genome duplication immediately basal to the split between mirbelioids and the rest; this is the clade that is notable for the occurrence of the non-protein amino acid canavanine. This duplication has also been implicated in nodule formation in Faboideae, perhaps helping to explain nodule diversity there (Q.-G. Li et al. 2013). See also rate shifts in Smith et al. (2011) and discussion below under Ecology &amp; Physiology.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within the NPAAA clade, there has been much diversification of Indigofereae  (aff. millettioids) in succulent biomes, clades growing there tending to be geographically more restricted than those common in grassland biomes; ages of crown groups of the four clades into which species of <i>Indigofera</i> fall is ca 15.5 m.y. or less (Schrire et al. 2009). Apparent independent increases in the rate of diversification in the Mirbelieae and Podalyrieae clades (mirbelioids) may rather be the results of extinctions caused by cooling climates and increased seasonality ca 32-30 m.y.a. in the early Oligocene (Crisp &amp; Cook 2009), and Crisp and Cook (2007) date the development of SW/SE Australian disjunctions to vicariant events caused by the development of aridity in the Nullarbor plane some 14-13 m.y.a. (other climatic events could also be implicated). The Australian Mirbelieae, with 675 species, include two thirds of all Australian Faboideae, and 470 of those species are included in <i>Pultenaea</i> s.l., which seems to have undergone a rapid radiation 25-20 m.y.a. (Crisp et al. 2004; Orthia et al. 2005a, b).  On the other hand, for Schnitzler et al. (2011) diversification of the ca 128 species of Podalyrieae in the Cape Flora began ca 33 m.y.a. at the end of the Eocene and was connected with shifts in how the plants survived fires. Divergence of woody clades in the Old World phaseoloids (millettioids) (crown group age ca 28.6 m.y.a.) has been associated with Late Oligocene warmness and aridity, and of herbaceous members with tropical arid climates in the Early Miocene (H. Li et al. 2013).  Robinieae may have been diversifying for some 30 m.y. in the neotropical seasonally dry tropical forest  (Pennington et al. 2009; Pennington &amp; Lavin 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Schaefer et al. (2012) suggest that Fabeae (IRLC), believed to be of eastern Mediterranean origin and originally with an annual habit, has moved at least 39 times into Eurasia alone, as well as to the New World, the Atlantic islands, and elsewhere.  The speciose <i>Astragalus</i>, with around 2,865 species, characterises drier areas of both hemispheres, and a number of taxa have
leaf rhachis spines; it separated from <i>Oxytropis</i> (the latter has a beak on its keel) 16-12 m.y.a., and diversification is still more recent. In particular, radiation in the speciose aneuploid New World neoastragalus clade (ca 500 species) started ca 4.4 m.y.a. (Wojciechowski 2004), with two invasions of west South America - there are over 100 species there - timed at a mere 2.07-1.62 m.y.a. (the larger group) and 1.23-0.79 m.y.a. (the smaller group) being followed by very high diversification rates in both (Scherson et al. 2008); see also Koenen et al. (2013).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Several major clades that are correlated with geography have been detected in <i>Lupinus</i>, another IRLC group (A&iuml;nouche &amp; Bayer 1999, support not very strong; A&iuml;nouche et al. 2004). Within the North American perennial clade there has
been a recent (ca 2.7 m.y.) Central American/Andean radiation that is now represented by over eighty species, some 56 of which grow in the p&aacute;ramo, and the rate of diversification increases as the genus moved into Andean South America from Central America (Moore &amp; Donoghue 2009; see also Silvestro et al. 2011; Sklen&aacute;r et al. 2011). <i>Lupinus</i> in the Andes, and in alpine North America, where there had been an earlier burst of diversification, are largely perennials (Drummond 2008; Drummond et al. 2012). The annual habit is plesiomorphous, and the alpine taxa in South America in particular show much variation in habit, etc.,  ranging from tussocks to shrubs 6 m tall (Hughes &amp; Atchison 2015). Perennials also diversified in eastern South America ca 6.5 m.y.a.; they are separately related to  east North American annuals (Drummond et al. 2012). This South American radiation may also be connected with the movement of bumble bees, pollinators of <i>Lupinus</i>, from North to South America some six m.y.a. (Hughes &amp; Eastwood 2006). All told, there are ca 171 species of <i>Lupinus</i> in South America versus ca 90 species in the whole northern hemisphere (von Hagen &amp; Kadereit 2003), and the evolution in the South American Andean species, at least, has been adaptive (Nevado et al. 2016).  Ree et al. (2003) studied aspects of <i>LEGCYC</i> gene evolution in the context of variation of floral morphology in the genus. However, as Givnish (2015b) notes, understanding the reasons for diversification s.l. in Andean <i>Lupinus</i> is not easy. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bello et al. (2012) suggest a couple of apomorphies for the family and for clades within it. For the direction of curvature of the young style, see  Prenner and Cardoso (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Introductory.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fabaceae often dominate in deciduous arid and semi-arid woody vegetation (Lewis et al. 2005; Schrire et al. 2005; M. Adams et al. 2016). They also grow in closed lowland tropical rainforest, but they are also often members of more open vegetation, even of early successional communities, in both tropical and temperate regions of the world. Faboideae-Robinieae are an important component of the neotropical seasonally dry tropical forests (Pennington et al. 2009). In the Cape fynbos vegetation there are some 250 species of <i>Aspalanthus</i> alone and in the West Australian kwongan over 135 species of <i>Acacia</i> (Cowling et al. 2000). Australia is unusual in that woody Fabaceae, especially <i>Acacia</i>, are notable components of most vegetation types, at least for part of the succession (Orians &amp; Milewski 2007). There has been much diversification within a number of geographically-restricted clades of Indigofereae that grow in succulent biomes (Schrire et al. 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Perhaps 16% of all woody species in neotropical l.t.r.f. are members of Fabaceae, especially Caesalpinioideae and Detarioideae (Burnham &amp; Johnson 2004), and they are notably commoner in Guiana than in western Amazonia - to 49 vs 10% of all trees (ter Steege et al. 2006). They are overwhelmingly the most common family in Amazonian forests in terms of numbers of species and individuals with stems 10 cm or more across, althouth they do not have a proportionally high number of locally abundant species (Gentry 1988; Hedin et al. 2009; Table 1; ter Steege et al. 2013); those species which do have high abundance values tend to be ECM plants (see below).  They make up 1/4 of the 20 species with most above-ground woody biomass (5 species, 2 known to be ECM,  = 4.96% of the total biomass), and 6/top 20 species ranked by productivity (Fauset et al. 2015); most of these are probably AM plants (B&eacute;reau &amp; Garbaye  1994) - note that <i>Dinitzia excelsa</i> is #931 in abundance, #25 in above-ground biomass (Fauset et al. 2015)! </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In Africa "acacia" (<i>Senegalia</i>, <i>Vachellia</i>) is a major component of the ca 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup> of microphyllous dry forests on relatively richer soils (Kalahari, E. Africa, the latter forests also with <i>Commiphora</i>) and in the drier Sudanian woodlands to the north (Timberlake et al. 2010). African savanna is also physiognomically distinctive because <i>Senegalia</i> and <i>Vachellia</i> trees, not very tall, have very broad crowns, having almost the shape of an open umbrella (Troll's model), and so this savanna looks different to savannas from other continents (Moncrieff et al. 2014). In eastern Africa there is a strong correlation between the diversity of "acacia" and the mammals that browse it, and mammalisn diversity is thought to drive the diversity patterns of the plants (Greve et al. 2012).  Various Detarioideae dominate the ca 2.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup> of Miombo woodland (Timberlake et al. 2010; see also below). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Nitrogen Fixation and Nitrogen Metabolism.</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is a substantial increase in leaf N at the crown-group Fabaceae node, along with a preference for less seasonality in precipitation (Cornwell et al. 2014). High N in the leaves has been linked to increased water use efficiency in woody N-fixing plants in general, rather than increased levels of photosynthesis, and legumes in particular have a complex nitrogen metabolism. N moves around the plant during growth, and extrapolating from agricultural legumes, it is likely to be remobilized from the leaves, ending up in large quantities in the seed. In general, N-containing compounds are involved in plant defence and in the water relations of the plant (Wink 2013; M. Adams et al. 2016), thus in <i>Inga</i>, a very speciose (ca 350 spp.) Neotropical mimosoid genus, several species may grow together, but they differ considerably in antiherbivore defence (Endara et al. 2015 and references; see also below).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Associations with N-fixing bacteria are very common in Fabaceae (see also Bacterial/Fungal Associations below). Estimates of biological N fixation in terrestrial environments, much of which is by bacteria associated with Fabaceae, are 90% of the total of 100-140 Tg [= 10<sup>12</sup>g) N fixed per annum (Gage 2004 and references: humans have doubled this). Substantial amounts of N can be fixed as NH<sub>3</sub> and moved to the plant, and then to the community when the legume dies or is eaten (e.g. Batterman et al. 2013: Panama). However, the role of legumes in the N cycle of tropical forests is unclear, although non-nodulating species are proportionally less common in the humid tropics (Simonsen et al. 2017). In Fabaceae N fixation is to a certain extent facultative in that the amount a plant fixes can change (Menge et al. 2014, see also below), and in old, relatively nutrient-rich forests, N fixation by legumes (in the example, species of <i>Inga</i>) decreases when compared with species growing in seasonally flooded forests and in light gaps (Barron et al. 2011; Hedren et al. 2009 for the "leaky nitrostat" model); other species of Fabaceae also have low fixation rates in mature forests (H&ouml;gberg 1986; Barron et al. 2011 and literature; Batterman et al. 2013: Sprent et al. 2013 for a summary). In Costa Rican secondary forests legumes grew more quickly, died more slowly, and recruited more poorly (?seed size) than plants that did not fix N (Menge &amp; Chazdon 2015). Interestingly, nodulation in the family in Amazonia is inversely correlated with its dominance, and so is proportionally less in the poorer soils of the Guianan Amazon where Fabaceae are abundant (ter Steege et al. 2006). The effectiveness of nodulation is often reduced in more acid soils, although <i>Lupinus</i> and <i>Mimosa</i> in Brazil, at least, may be exceptions (Lin et al. 2012). N-fixing tropical forest legumes may have a competitive advantage over non-nodulators as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increases (Cernusak et al. 2011), which might affect how one thinks of the history of the family. Interestingly, N-fixing fabaceous trees are very uncommon north of 35%<sup>o</sup>N (Menge et al. 2014). See also Terpolilli et al. (2011) for the efficiency of nitrogen fixation.</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Interactions between legumes and their N-fixing bacteria go far beyond any simple association of the two and resultant fixation of nitrogen. In <i>Acacia mangium</i> nodulation and leaf nitrogen are increased if the plants are ectomycorrhizal (Diagne et al. 2013), while in endomycorrhizal Fabaceae phosphorus uptake by the fungus may affect N fixation (Walker et al. 2013 and references), for instance enabling growth of nodulated seedlings in the nutritionally harsh conditions of sand dunes (van der Heijden et al. 2015b). Nodules in <i>Medicago</i> can be formed both by N-fizing or non-N-fixing  ("exploitative") rhizobia, and plants with mixture of exploitative and non-exploitative rhizobia did less well than plants with only N-fixing rhizobia under conditions of no herbivory, but the two performed equally poorly if there was herbivory (Simonsen &amp; Stinchcombe 2014). There are also interactions with endomycorrhizal fungi here, with complex interactions at the level of gene expression (Afkhami &amp; Stinchcombe 2016).</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">There may be a trade-off between extrafloral nectaries and N fixation. Godschalx et al. (2015) found that N-fixing rhizobia in <i>Phaseolus lunatus</i> reduced the amount of nectar produced in these nectaries and hence the attractiveness of the plant to ants. N fixation utilises much of the host's photosynthate which otherwise could be used to produce nectar, but the nitrogen fixed was used in the production of another form of defence, cyanogenetic compounds (Godschalx et al. 2015). Finally, synthesis of pyrrolizine alkaloids occurred in <i>Crotalaria</i> as a result of the reprogramming of the plant genome that occurs during nodulation (Benedito et al. 2008), and although details of the synthetic pathway are unclear, at least the initial enzyme involved was from the plant; if N levels were high, there was no nodulation and no alkaloid production (Irmer et al. 2015). However, details of such interactions between plant and bacterium are poorly known.</p>
 
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Indeed, Fabaceae have a very distinctive nitrogen metabolism (see M. Adams et al. 2016 and references). Non-protein amino acids are common (see e.g. Fowden et al. 1979), and nitrogen in the xylem sap is transported as a mixture of amino acids, amides, and sometimes also ureides; very little is transported as nitrate. Wojciechowski et al. (2003, 2004, see also Wojciechowski 2003) note that the distribution of some non-protein amino acids are systematically interesting. L-canavanine, which can be taken up in place of the normal amino acid L-arginine, may have potent effects on herbivores, although some can detoxify it (e.g. Rosenthal 1990, 2001 and references; Kergoat et al. 2005b; Huang et al. 2011: non-protein amino acids in general). L-canaline is rather like the amino acid ornithine; both L-canaline and L-canavanine serve as nitrogen reserves for the plant. A number of Fabaceae have cyanogenic glucosides. Here plant-insect interactions have been studied in detail, for instance, those between the cyanogenic host, <i>Lotus corniculatus</i>, and  caterpillars of the burnett moth, <i>Zygaena filipendulae</i>; the latter can also synthesize the cyanogenic compounds itself (Zagrobelny &amp; M&oslash;ller 2011: references to other systems; see also Takos et al. 2011). Alkaloid glucosides are known, e.g. from <i>Vicia</i>, and Pentzold et al. (2014) discuss ways insects have of getting around such defences. Interestingly, canavanine and alkaloid production are mutually exclusive, while within the genistoids quinolizidine and pyrrolizidine alkaloids are similarly mutually exclusive (Wink 2008). For the toxic indolizidine alkaloid, swainsonine, found in a few members of the IRLC clade, see below under plant-fungal relationships.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">When and where the associations between Fabaceae and their nitrogen fixers developed is unclear (but see J. J. Doyle 2011; Sprent et al. 2013). The first association presumably occurred some time after the Late Cretaceous crown-group age of the family, so ca 65 m.y.a. is the very earliest. Conservative estimates are that N-fixation arose 6-7 times in the family (J. J. Doyle 2011). In Faboideae, nodulation may involve the cooption of genes from a genome duplication event estimated at ca 54 m.y.a. (op den Camp et al. 2011; Q.-G. Li et al. 2013). Indeed, legumes in which the bacterial associations persist over evolutionary time, stable nitrogen fixers, are commonest in areas with cooler temperatures, whether associated with altitude or latitude, and are particularly frequent in Faboideae, often herbaceous plants and the commonest legumes in these conditions (Werner et al. 2015; see also Menge &amp; Crews 2016 for latitudinal patterns in N fixation, also <a name=Fabsecphys>above</a>). Free-living bacteria closely related to N-fixing rhizobia are very common indeed in conifer-dominated forests, in North America at least (VanInsberghe et al. 2015; for further details, see <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#EctomycorrhizalPlants" target="home">below</a>). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Ectomycorrhizae (ECM).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some Fabaceae - most records are from the Old World, particularly African,  Detarioideae - are ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and do not fix nitrogen (e.g. Onguene &amp; Kuyper 2001; for further details see <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#EctomycorrhizalPlants" target="home">clade asymmetries</a>); the ECM habit has evolved at least four times in the family (M. E. Smith et al. 2011). Estimates of the number of Detarioideae involved range from 250 (Brundrett 2009) to 450 (B. Mackinder pers. comm. viii.2012) species. Some 36 of the ca 82 genera included in Detarioideae are reported to be at least locally dominant (e.g. Letouzey 1968; Mackinder 2005), 11 of these genera being in the rather small Macrolobieae/the <i>Berlinia</i> clade of only 16 genera (see also Wieringa &amp; Gervais 2003). Some Detarioideae are endomycorrhizal/vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) plants (see <i>Cynometra</i> below).</p>

<img src="Fabdet.gif" width="378" height="186" border="1" align="right" alt="African Detarioideae"><p style="text-indent: 30px;">All told, Detarioideae occupy ca 2.8-3.3 m km<sup>2</sup> in the Zambezian region alone (estimated from White 1983). In Miombo forests they represent 20-90% of the trees, 30-96% of the basal area, and with biomass estimates in the range of 35-97 Mg ha-1 (H&ouml;gberg  &amp; Piearce 1986; Frost 1996). Genera like <i>Isoberlinia</i> and <i>Brachystegia</i> are very important components of the widespread deciduous Miombo forests which grow on often rather poor soils over some 2.7 million km<sup>2</sup> or more of central Africa, and these forests are the centre of diversity of <i>Brachystegia</i> (e.g. White 1983; H&ouml;gberg 1990; S. E. Smith &amp; Read 2008; Timberlake et al. 2010). Many other species, both of trees and herbs, also grow in these communities, and the trees include other ECM taxa like <i>Monotes</i> (Dipterocarpaceae) and <i>Uapaca</i> (Phyllanthaceae) (White 1983).  The AM <i>Colophospermum mopane</i>, an important food for elephants, dominates ca 380,000 km<sup>2</sup> of mopane woodland (e.g. H&ouml;gberg &amp; Piearce 1986; Torti et al. 2001; Mackinder 2005; Newbery et al. 2006), these, along with Miombo forests, form a major part of the Zambezian Region. The ECM <i>Isoberlinia</i> is a major component of Sudanian Woodland (White 1983) which forms an interrupted band south of the Sahara from Mali to Uganda (White 1983; map: very approximate, from White 1983). In savannas, shallower-rooted  grasses may obtain water obtained at some depth by trees (by hydraulic lift), which helps the savanna community to persist (K. Yu &amp; D'Odorico 2015). This forest is biogeographically closest to Miombo woodlands among other African vegetation types (Linder et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In Africa, even LTRF can include a substantial element of ECM Fabaceae. Indeed, a caesalpinioid Biafran forest subtype has been recognised, and here, of 34 genera recorded, 28 are members of Detarioideae, and 11 of these are described as being characteristically gregarious (Letouzey 1968; see also B&acirc; et al. 2011a). <i>Microberlinia</i> dominates Guineo-Congolian forests in Cameroon, and other Detarioideae dominate parts of the coastal forest from Sierra Leone to western Gabon, and again in the periphery of the Zaire basin (White 1983). Newbery (1997) noted that  Detarioideae in Cameroon LTRF grew on poor soils and seemed to be able to control the flow of phosphorus through the ecosystem to their own benefit, however, fertilization with phosphorus had little effect on their growth (Newbery et al. 2002); Van der Burgt and Eyakwe (2008) give information about a ca 35 km<sup>2</sup> caesalpinioid-dominated area in the Korup Forest. <i>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei</i>, whose foliage, seeds, and perhaps even mycorrhizae are major food sources for elephants, etc. (Blake &amp; Fay 1997), dominates ca 10,000 ha in the eastern Congo (see also Bastin et al. 2015). There it has above-ground biomass of 394-411.1 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>, about 74% of the total (Makana et al. 2011); it may occupy 88% of the total basal area in the forests it dominates (Hart et al. 1989). Torti et al. (2001) discussed the factors that seemed to facilitate dominance of <i>Gilbertiodendron</i>, including the dense shade it cast, deep leaf litter, handling the potentially low availability of nitrogen, etc.. However, Peh et al. (2011a) found little difference in the soil of <i>Gilbertiodendron</i> forests in Cameroon when compared with that of adjacent forests, but they noted that there might be differences in such forests elsewhere and that ECM fungi might be involved in the dominance relationships of these forests.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In the New World, the ECM <i>Aldina</i> (Faboideae: 50 kb inversion clade) and the coppicing <i>Dicymbe</i> (Detarioideae) dominate forests in the Pakaraima Mountains in the central Guiana Shield region (ter Steege et al. 2006; McGuire 2007b; M. E. Smith et al. 2011). The latter in particular supports a rich community of fungi (Smith et al. 2011; Henkel et al. 2012) and has a remarkably high basal area of 38.4-52.5 m<sup>2</sup> per hectare, around 25(-40) m<sup>2</sup> being more normal figures (Henkel 2003). <i>Aldina</i> is also common in Amazonian rainforst (ter Steege et al. 2013; see also Ramos et al. 2015). The ECM <i>Peltogyne</i> (Detarioideae) is one of the rare monodominants of the northern Amazon, where it occupies ca 53% of the basal area of trees 10 cm or more in d.b.h. on Maraca Island, Roraima, a figure that increases in proportion in larger trees (Nascimento &amp; Proctor 1997; Nascimento et al. 1997). The Guianan upland ECM/AM <i>Eperua falcata</i>, along with <i>E. leucantha</i> (mycorrhizae?), also Detarioideae, are 50% more abundant (usually far more) than any other non-palm of the 20 most abundant hyperdominant trees (10 cm d.b.h. or more) of the Amazonian rainforest (Peh et al. 2011b; ter Steege et al. 2013; Fauset et al. 2015, see also above; <i>E. falcata</i> perhaps AM - e.g. B&eacute;reau &amp; Garbaye 1994).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Not all monodominant legumes are ECM (Torti &amp; Coley 1999; Torti et al. 2001; Peh et al. 2011b). Legumes like the AM <i>Mora excelsa</i> (it also harbours endophytes), Caesalpinioideae so not immediately related to Detarioideae, dominates ca 37,000 hectares in Trinidad  (Beard 1946; Hart et al. 1989). Interestingly, like ECM plants, both foliar and litter nitrogen contents are low, there is foliar resorbtion of nitrogen, soil nitrate concentrations are low, litter decomposes slowly and accumulates - perhaps the roots get the nitrogen the plant needs from this surface layer (Brookshire &amp; Thomas 2013). Two other species of AM <i>Mora</i> may also be monodominants, as is the AM (and clonal) <i>Pentaclethra</i> and <i>Prioria copaifera</i>, <i>Pentaclethra macroloba</i> representing 16-18% of the above ground biomass in some Costa Rican forests (Torti et al. 1997; Henkel 2003; Peh et al. 2011b; Menge &amp; Chazdon 2015). The Old World <i>Cynometra</i> (Detarioideae) also appears to be AM (e.g. Connell &amp; Lowman 1989; Peh et al. 2011b), and <i>Cynometra alexandri</i> dominates ca 11,000 ha in Uganda (Eggeling 1947) and in some forests in the eastern Congo where it comes close to dominating (ca 31.5% of above-ground biomass) the ECM <i>Julbernardia secretii</i> adds another ca 12% (Makana et al. 2011: the next species adds 4.8%). <i>Cynometra</i> forests do not accumulate large amounts of litter, but that is also true of the ECM <i>Julbernardia</i> (Torti et al. 2001). <i>Talbotiella gentii</i> (?= <i>Hymenostegia</i>) forms monodominant stands in dry forests in Ghana, but the soil composition in unremarkable; seedlings tolerate shade and there is some vegetative reproduction (Swaine &amp; Hall 1981), and although its mycorrhizal status is unknown, that of its immediate relatives is usually AM (Bechem et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Thus although the relationship between mono- or oligodominance of legumes in tropical forests in particular and the nature of their fungal associations is not simple, the combination of phylogeny, monodominance and mycorrhizal type in legumes is strong. Of the nine dominant tropical species listed by Hart et al. (1989), five are caesalpinioids, of which three are ECM Detarioideae (two more are ECM dipterocarps), while all the dominants listed by Connell and Lowman (1989) were legumes. 12/22 of the tropical classical monodominants listed by Peh et al. (2011b) are legumes, of which 4/9 whose mycorrhizal status is known are  ECM plants (the others are <i>Cynometra</i>, <i>Pentaclethra</i> and three species of <i>Mora</i>). Of the other ecological attributes of these legumes, all had poor dispesal, masting occurred in all but two (two of the three species of <i>Mora</i>), and the seeds were medium-sized to large, being 5-117 g in weight (Peh et al. 2011b). All told, these dominant tropical legumes are characterized by a syndrome of ecological  features that includes growing on poor soils, having large seeds with poor dispersal, accumulating litter and accessing organic nitrogen, tolerating shade, etc. (e.g. Alexander 1989b; Hart 1990; Torti et al. 2001; B&acirc; et al. 2011b). However, Newbery (2005, see Hogberg 1986) noted that mast fruiting had not been recorded from East African forest dominated by caesalpinioids, while Nascimento and Proctor (1997) noted that there was little difference between  the soils on which the ECM <i>Peltogyne</i> dominated and those in adjacent more diverse forests. Interestingly, Gentry (1993) compared the ecological role of ECM dipterocarps in the Old World with that of caesalpinioid legumes in the New World, particularly on poor soils and under seasonal climates. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Other.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">N-fixing taxa like some species of <i>Lupinus</i>, e.g. <i>Lupinus albus</i>, <i>Stylosanthes</i> and <i>Aspalanthus</i> may also form root clusters of varying morphologies, and in some cases these have been shown to facilitate phosphorus uptake in P-poor soils (e.g. Shane et al. 2004b and references; Lambers et al. 2006, 2012b). The overall appearance of such roots is rather regular and dauciform, but this carrot-like shape is made by the dense, spreading lateral roots, not by root hairs as in dauciform roots proper (Shane &amp; Lambers 2005; Shane et al. 2006). Species of <i>Lupinus</i> with such roots (especially common in Old World), and some with ordinary roots (from the New World) release massive amounts of carboxylates (organic anions) such as citrate into the soil, sometimes in amounts up to 23% of dry mass, and these can replace organic or inorganic P on soil particles and so mobilize it (Lambers et al. 2013 and references). Development of cluster roots has been linked to low foliar P concentration (X. Wang et al. 2015). Since <i>Lupinus</i> can also fix nitrogen, it can be an aggressive pioneer on volcanic and other skeletal and nutrient-poor soils (Lambers et al. 2013). Interestingly, both <i>L. albus</i> and some other species of the genus that lack the ability to form these cluster roots are also unable to form mycorrhizal associations (Delaux et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fabaceae are perhaps the second most important family of lianes, both ecologically and in terms of number of species, in the New World, with about 720 climbing species recorded from there alone (Gentry 1991).  Fabaceae are also prominent in drier forest types in both America and Africa (Lewis et al. 2005; Schrire et al. 2005), and lianes also are prominent in such forests  (Gentry  1988; Schnitzer 2005). Fabaceae quite commonly have positive root pressures, which may reduce the susceptibility of liane stems to irreversible cavitation (Fisher et al. 1997, but c.f. Knipfer et al. 2016). Vessels in the stem of <i>Entada</i> are up to 700 &mu;m across (Ewers et al. 2015)! For additional information about leguminous lianes, see  Angyalossy et al. (2015; also Schnitzer et al. 2015).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> About 27 species of <i>Astragalus</i> in North America are hyperaccumulators of the sulphur-antagonist selenium (Se) (El Mehdawi et al. 2012; Schiavon &amp; Pilon-Smits 2016), which is stored as &#947-glutamyl-methyselenocysteine; this may be associated with nodulation and also help protect the plant from herbivores (Alford et al. 2014). Se-accumulation seems to have evolved more than once here, and <i>Astragalus</i> includes the largest complex of Se accumulators in seed plants (White 2016); endophytic bacteria are involved in Se uptake, which can be up to ca 1.5% dry weight, 30% elemental Se concentration (Lindblom et al. 2013; Sura-deJong et al. 2015).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Knoblauch et al. (2001) discuss the function of the distinctive spindle-shaped non-dispersive protein bodies (= forisomes) that are common in the sieve tubes of Faboideae (e.g. Behnke 1981b; Behnke &amp; Pop 1981; Peters et al. 2010; M&uuml;ller et al. 2014). The forisomes can block the pores of the sieve plates when turgor pressure changes, and they can change their shape and volume very quickly depending on the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions; ATP is not needed for this shape change (Peters et al. 2007, 2008, 2010). Within Faboideae, forisomes are absent from a number of Galegeae, many members of which - including those species of <i>Astragalus</i> studied - also lack calcium oxalate crystals (Peters et al. 2010). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Pollination Biology.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although one often thinks of the monosymmetric pea or papilionoid flower and its variants as characterising the family - bar the mimosoids - as a whole, this much underestimates the great variation in floral morphology in many "Caesalpinioideae" and basal clades of Faboideae in particular. As Bruneau et al. (2005, p. 201) noted of caesalpinioid legumes, "zygomorphy is expressed as a multitude of homoplasious morphs". Variation in pollen morphology is also considerable in basal "Caesalpinioideae" (Graham &amp; Barker 1981; Banks et al. 2003), and Banks and Rudall (2016) speculate on the  functional significance of this variation. Detarioideae in particular show much floral variation, with the complete loss of organs or whorls of organs often being associated with  major dislocations of developmental patterns (Tucker 2000; Bruneau et al. 2014), while corolla development in the speciose <i>Inga</i> is notably labile, the median petal being adaxial or abaxial, depending on the species (Paulino et al. 2017). Within Faboideae (= Papilionoideae), papilionoid flowers are found only in a subset, albeit a large subset, of the clade and are probably derived within it. Thus the flowers of <i>Swartzia</i>, perhaps sister to all other Faboideae, are very different from those of all other Fabaceae in their single banner petal, numerous free, mostly infertile and very dimorphic stamens, and absence of nectar (Tucker 2003b), and there is considerable floral variation - but rarely including papilionoid flowers - in other basal Faboideae (e.g. Mansano et al. 2002, 2004). Heteranthy, as in <i>Swartzia</i>, is notably common in Fabaceae, although less so in the mimosoid clade (Vallejo-Mar&iacute;n et al. 2010), and Paulino et al. (2016) describe how this works in some Faboideae. In <i>Lupinus</i> the different stamen morphs, members of different whorls, produce different kinds of pollen, the inner whorl, opening later, producing sterile pollen that contains starch but no lipids, while in <i>Cytisus</i> the pollen from the two morphs - both found in anthers of the same whorl - is deposited on different places on the pollinator, and although pollen from both types of anthers germinated <i>in  vitro</i>, this was not so <i>in vivo</i> (Paulino et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Hardly surprisingly, Fabaceae attract a diversity of pollinators that visit the flowers for various rewards; Lewis et al. (2000) summarize what is known about pollination in Fabaceae, especially in "Caesalpinioideae". Bat pollination is quite common in tropical members of the family (Fleming et al. 2009), bats visiting flowers with a variety of morphologies. Bee pollination is particularly common, <i>Xylocopa</i> bees alone visiting some 52 genera (Leppik 1966; Hurd 1978; Kalin Arroyo 1981; Lewis et al. 2000).  Pollination in "Caesalpinioideae" is predominantly by polylectic bees, while oligolectic bees are commoner pollinators of the mimosoid clade and some Faboideae. Oligolectic bees are more speciose in (warm) temperate regions, especially Mediterranean climates (Michener 1979; Kuhlmann &amp; Eardley 2012), and that is where the latter two subfamilies are particularly common. Even if papilionoid flowers are not as widespread as one might think, flowers with banner petals are indeed common in non-mimosoid Fabaceae. Faboideae are pollinated mostly by polylectic bees, and in a variety of ways, and the plants are a major source of both nectar and pollen (Goulson 2010: U.K. species). Keel flowers are pollinated by medium-sized to large bees, since they can "work" the flowers more easily, and large bees also pollinate Faboideae with inverted keel flowers (Amaral-Neto et al. 2015, q.v. for floral modifications involved); inverted keel flowers are found in genera like <i>Canavalia</i>. Interestingly, within the tropics bees seem to be commonest in the New World (Michener 1979), and woody Fabaceae are especially diverse there.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">North temperate megachilid osmiine bees like <i>Hoplitis</i> species of the <i>Annonosmia</i>-<i>Hoplitis</i> group collect pollen from concealed-pollen flowers of the family and/or  members of Boraginaceae; polylecty is derived in this group of bees (Sedivy et al. 2013). The bees may visit flowers of these two groups - which have very different morphologies - because both have pyrrolizidine alkaloids and/or particular nutrients that are essential for the growth of the bee larvae (Sedivy et al. 2013).  </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The monosymmetric papilionoid flower has a more or less erect banner petal, two wing petals, and paired interlocking keel petals enclosing the stamens; bee pollination is the norm here (for pollination in keel flowers in general, see Westerkamp 1996, 1997). The micromorphology of the epidermis differs between different petals of a single flower. The outer surfaces of the wing petals in particular are variously sculpted (Tewari &amp; Nair 1979), with pockets and folds that afford footholds for the pollinator (Le Roux &amp; van Wyk 2012) in Faboideae, at least (Stirton 1981; Ojeda et al. 2009). Colour patterning of the corolla is conspicuous, as in <i>Lupinus</i>, also <i>Caesalpinia</i>, and <i>Bauhinia</i>, and is always on the adaxial banner petal; these petals may also absorb ultraviolet light. The colour patterning on the standard of <i>Hardenbergia violacea</i> (Faboideae) may even mimic an anther (Lunau 2006). Although the flowers of <i>Cercis</i> are only superficially similar to those of Faboideae (Tucker 2002a), they, too, have keels and are similar functionally, although <i>Cercis</i> lacks the sculpturing on the wing petals that is common in Faboideae. In some <i>Caesalpinia</i> s.l. the abaxial sepal is coloured and more or less functions as a keel. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The nature of the reward for the bee varies, as is how the pollen is presented and where any nectar is to be found. When the androecium is monadelphous, i.e. the filaments of all the stamens are connate, there is no nectar and the reward for the
pollinator is often pollen. This can be delivered by a pump-type secondary pollen presentation mechanism: The bee lands on the keel, and the style then forces pollen out of the tip of the keel in a tooth paste-like strand, as in <i>Lupinus</i>. If the androecium is diadelphous - nine stamens are connate and a single adaxial stamen is free - the reward is often nectar, the nectary
lying between the filament tube and gynoecium and being quite variable in morphology (see also Leite et al. 2015 for access to nectar); <i>Indigofera</i> even has short, nectar-secreting spurs (see also Vogel 1997; Davis et al. 1988). Other taxa like <i>Cytisus</i>, <i>Medicago</i>, Desmodieae and <i>Indigofera</i> have explosive pollination. Here the style, held under tension, is released when the pollinator lands, and it breaks the keel as it were , scattering pollen over the insect (e.g. Polhill 1976); such flowers can be visited only once. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Buzz pollination is quite common in Fabaceae. It occurs throughout <i>Cassia</i>, <i>Chamaechrista</i> and <i>Senna</i> ("Caesalpinioideae": Lewis et al.  2000). Here the anthers have four different modes of development (Tucker 1996b). The flowers of <i>Senna</i> are often enantiostylous (enantiostyly is likely to have been acquired once, although also subsequently lost); the anthers are basifixed and porose. There are three (or more) stamen morphs: three abaxial staminodes, four middle medium-sized stamens from which pollen is taken by the bees, and three longer abaxial stamens pollen from which is actually involved in pollination (see Tucker 1996b; Marazzi &amp; Endress 2008; Marazzi et al. 2007).  <i>Cassia</i> s. str., with dorsifixed anthers, also has three stamen morphs. The filaments are curved and the anthers have slits or basal pores. Finally, the largely herbaceous <i>Chamaecrista</i> is also enantiostylous; the stamens have two morphs in different whorls, the filaments are short, and the basifixed anthers dehisce by pores and have a
velcro-like line of hairs (Tucker 1996b). Westerkamp (2004) suggests that in some species of both <i>Senna</i> and <i>Chamaecrista</i> the orientation of the anthers is such that the pollen ejected when the flower is vibrated initially misses the bee entirely, but it bounces off the petals and then lands on the bee's back - whence it is removed by the stigma; enantiostyly is an integral part of this remarkable pollination mechanism. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bird pollination is scattered in Fabaceae. The some 105 species of the pantropical/warm temperate <i>Erythrina</i> are pollinated by perching (sun) and hovering (humming) birds. Both floral morphology and how the flowers and inflorescences are held varies according the requirements of these different visitors, and there may have been four or more shifts from passerine to hummingbird pollination in the genus (Bruneau 1997; Mabberley 2008 for summary).</p> 


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Secondary pollen presentation occurs in Fabeae and a number of other Faboideae. Here the pollinator picks up the pollen from the pollen brush at the end of the style; this has evolved perhaps eight times (e.g. Lavin &amp; Delgado-S. 1990). In the asymmetrical flowers characteristic of Phaseolinae the labellum is twisted, forming a tube rather like an elephant trunk; this is why <i>Vigna caracalla</i> is called the corkscrew vine (c.f. <i>Pedicularis</i>: Orobanchaceae). When the bee lands on the flower, pollen is extruded from the end of the tube (Delgado-Salinas et al. 2011). Endress (2012) suggested that floral asymmetry was a key innovation in Phaseoleae. </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The mimosoid clade has flowers that are very different from those of most other Fabaceae.  Numerous often small, polysymmetric flowers are grouped together in a dense raceme or head, all flowers opening at about the same time, and this is the unit of attraction. The pollen grains are frequently aggregated into polyads which are caught in a cup-shaped stigma that is of the appropriate size for the polyad of that species, and there are also about as many ovules in the ovary as there are pollen grains in the polyad (Kenrick 2003: implications of this pollination mechanism for the breeding system; Banks et al. 2010). Banks et al. (2011) note that all the pollen grains of a polyad form a single harmomegathic unit. Anthers in many of the mimosoid clade have terminal glands that are variable in morphology/anatomy, although little is known about any functions they might have (Luckow &amp; Grimes 1997; de Barros &amp; Teixera 2015) - perhaps they produce an odour (Tybirk 1997)? For nectaries, which are on the inside of the staminal tube/hypanthium, see Ancibor (1969); they are, for example, absent from <i>Acacia</i> s.l., although found in taxa now placed in <i>Senegalia</i> (e.g. Pedley 1986; Tybirk 1997). In <i>Calliandra</i> s. str. the polyads sometimes have an associated sticky mucilage body by which they are attached to the pollinator, but the stigma is much larger and capitate and the polyads adhere to its surface (Prenner &amp; Teppner 2005; Greissl 2006, c.f. in part Teppner 2007). Bats may also be pollinators, as in <i>Parkia</i> (Bumrungsri et al. 2008 and refs). For more information on locellate anthers (scattered in the clade), polyads and pollen morphology, anther dehiscence, etc., see Guinet (1981 and references: pollen), Prenner and Teppner (2005), Teppner (2007) and Teppner and Stabentheiner (2007, 2010) and references.  </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is considerable variation in stigma morphology; the stigmas are porose to crateriform and may have an exudate (Dulberger et al. 1994; Marazzi et al. 2007; Costa et al. 2014). How the pollen gets to the receptive surface in stigmas with very small pores is poorly known. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Seed Dispersal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The legume s. str. is a single carpellate
fruit that dehisces explosively, the two valves of the carpel twisting as they separate. Such fruits have two layers of lignified fibres, at least one of which is oblique to the long axis of the fruit (Fahn &amp; Zohary 1955). A legume so defined is common in European-North American Faboideae, but also in <i>Bauhinia</i>, <i>Duparquetia</i>, Detarioideae (where seeds of emergent <i>Tetraberlinia moreliana</i> may be thrown some 60 m - e.g. van der Burgt 1997), and so on. The fruits of <i>Cercis</i> are not explosively dehiscent, but are otherwise similar - and they are also typologically rather similar to the fruits of <i>Myristica</i>, the nutmeg! Overall there is a great diversity of fruit morphology in the family, including variously winged fruits, fleshy fruits, arillate aeeds, fruits breaking up into single-seeded units in different ways, and fruits modified for external animal transport with spines and hooks, for example, the velcro-like hooks on <i>Desmodium</i> (hence its common name, beggar's ticks) and the indehiscent, spiny, spirally-coiled fruits of many species of <i>Medicago</i> (for their evolution, see Fourquin et al. 2013). In <i>Trifolium</i> the calyx and corolla are both involved in fruit dispersal. Arillate seeds are common and are eaten by birds in particular, and legumes are  an important food source for frugivorous birds in Africa and Southeast Asia-Malesia in particular (Snow 1981). However, seeds of <i>Abrus precatorius</i> and <i>Pithecellobium</i> have red and black colour patterns on the coat and mimic the colour contrasts of these arillate seeds, and mimicry, of either an aril (seed bicoloured) or a fleshy fruit, occurs in <i>Erythrina</i>, <i>Rhynchosia</i> and <i>Ormosia</i>, all sizeable genera (McKey 1975; Foster &amp; Delay 1998; c.f. transference of function, Corner 1958) - but chewing the seeds of <i>Abrus precatorius</i> is not recommended. Close to a thousand Faboideae are myrmecochorous, myrmecochory occuring in many species of <i>Acacia</i> s. str. and other Australian Fabaceae (Mckey 1989; Orians &amp; Milewski 2007; Lengyel et al. 2009, 2010); independent evolution of this dispersal mode has occurred several times within the family. Dispersal of seeds by water has evolved more than once  in <i>Canavalia</i> (Snak et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In many taxa, especially those with explosively dehiscent fruits, the seed coat is very hard and may need scarification for germination to occur (for fruits and seeds, see Corner 1951; van der Pijl 1956; Kirkbride et al. 2003; etc.). For other aspects of the ecology of seed coats, see Souza and Marcos-Filho (2001).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Herbivory by foliovorous insects is often quite marked on Fabaceae, despite the diversity of their defensive secondary metabolites, herbivores in general preferring to feed on nitrogen-rich plants, which those of Fabaceae certainly are (Simonsen &amp; Stinchcombe 2014 and references). <i>Cassia fistula</i> is sometimes almost defoliated by caterpillars of pierid butterflies (pers. obs.), while up to one third or more of the developing foliage of species of <i>Inga</i> may be eaten by herbivores (Kursar et al. 2009). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Associations of insects and Fabaceae are often quite close. Caterpillars of Lycaenidae-Curetinae, -Riodininae-Riodinini and especially -Lycaeninae-Lycaenini butterflies are often found on Fabaceae (Ehrlich &amp; Raven 1964; Fiedler 1991, 1995), in part because of the close association between many lycaenid caterpillars and ants, and ants are often conspicuously active on Fabaceae (see also Pierce et al. 2002). Similarly, larvae of the some 260 species in 15+ genera  of Coliadinae and Dismorphiinae (Pieridae) butterflies,  are found here (Braby &amp; Trueman 2006: a quarter of the records, see also Brassicales and Santalales; the African Pseudopontiinae are recorded from Acanthaceae and Opiliaceae, Robinson et al. consulted vii.2015), and Fabaceae may be the original food plants of Pieridae (Braby &amp; Trueman 2006; Wheat et al. 2007; Fordyce 2010). Caterpillars of the skipper group Eudaminae are also quite common on Fabaceae (Warren et al. 2009). The diversity of caterpillars, especially that of "basal" butterfly groups, including <i>Baronia</i>, sister to all Papilionidae whose caterpillars eat <i>Acacia</i> (Heikkil&auml; et al. 2011; see also Ehrlich &amp; Raven 1964), on Fabaceae is such that Janz and Nylin (1998) and Braby and Trueman (2006) suggested that Fabaceae might be the springboard for host-plant diversification of butterflies feeding on angiosperms in general (see also the introduction to Fabales). That would then mean that diversification of these butterflies would be very largely Caenozoic, given suggestions for the age of Fabaceae (see above).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some 70% of the 1,700 seed beetles, bruchids (Chrysomelidae-Bruchinae [used to be Bruchidae]), are associated with Fabaceae. Two clades, made up largely of New World <i>Acanthoscelides</i> and predominantly Old World <i>Bruchidius</i> (neither monophyletic), dominate, and their hosts are mostly members of the mimosoid clade and a diversity of Faboideae (and in <i>Acanthoscelides</i> some Malvaceae, and <i>Spermophagus</i> Malvaceae and Convolvulaceae in particular). In Faboideae they detoxify the non-protein amino acid, L-canavanine (Kergoat et al. 2005b, 2006). Divergence of the beetles is estimated at around 60 m.y.a. near the time of origin of Fabaceae, and of <i>Acanthoscelides</i> and <i>Bruchidius</i> in particular ca 49.5 m.y.a. (Kergoat et al. 2005b, 2011). Stem Bruchinae are rather older, and may initially have eaten members of Arecaceae (q.v.); from Faboideae, probably their original host within Fabaceae, they moved on to other groups following the chemistry of the plants (esp. Kergoat et al. 2005a, b; also Johnson 1989, 1990: <i>Acanthoscelides</i>; Birch et al. 1989: chemistry of the interaction; Janzen 1969: the complexity of the association; Kato et al. 2010: importance of female oviposition preferences; Kergoat et al. 2015: <i>Spermophagus</i>). The larvae are specialized seed-eaters, and particular groups of bruchids may be associated with particular groups of Fabaceae (e.g. Kergoat et al. 2006: <i>Bruchus</i> and Vicieae, <i>Sennius</i> on <i>Cassia</i>, 2011 and references). For estimates of when particular groups of bruchids diversified on particular clades of Faboideae, see Kergoat et al. (2011). The pattern of association of bruchid groups with mimosoids is interesting and often quite specific (Kergoat et al. 2007); individual bruchid genera tend to be found on adajcent pectinations of the mimosoid phylogenetic tree (Kergoat et al. 2007), but in <i>Spermophagus</i>, which does not eat Fabaceae, there is less specificity (Kergoat et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the diversification of Psyllidae (jumping plant lice; Hemiptera-Sternorrhyncha) on Macaronesian Faboideae-Genisteae, see Percy et al. (2004). Psyllids are quite common there, and the diversification of psyllids has been dated to around 3 m.y.a., well after that of their hosts which is dated at ca 8 m.y.a. (Percy et al. 2004).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Six subtribes including  about 60% of the almost 1,000 species in the straight-snouted weevil Brentidae-Apioninae-Apionini are found on Fabaceae-Faboideae, perhaps moving there from the [[Frankeniaceae +
Tamaricaceae] [Plumbaginaceae + Polygonaceae]] clade no later than the Upper Cretaceous (Winter et al. 2016: numerous dates for weevil diversification). Pinz&oacute;n-Navarro et al. (2010) discuss the weevils found on <i>Inga</i>; for diversification of this genus, see above.  </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In another variant of insect-plant relationships, the flowers of <i>Crotalaria</i> are visted by Danainae and Ctenuchidae because the pyrrolizidine alkaloids they contain are used as the basis of the pheromones of these lepidoptera (also Asteraceae, and wilting plants of some Boraginaceae and Heliotropaceae: Edgar et al. 1974; Pliske 1975; Boppre&eacute; 1986). <i>Crotalaria</i> is also associated with arctiid moths such as <i>Utetheisa</i>, its secondary metabolites providing defence for the young, etc. (Eisner &amp; Meinwald 1995; Hartmann 2009; other articles in Conner et al. 2009; Zaspel et al. 2014 for the evolution of pharmacophagy in Arctiinae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Rather generalized legume/ant associations are very common in Fabaceae and are mediated by the extrafloral nectaries so common here. The nectar secreted, which usually contains sucrose, attracts ants that can protect the plant against herbivorous insects; a variety of ants may be attracted to the nectaries of a single legume species (Schemske  1983). Such nectaries have possibly evolved some 35 times, and have also subsequently been lost and even regained (e.g. Marazzi et al. 2011, 2015; see also McKey 1989). They are notably common in the mimosoid clade (perhaps only one origin) and are found towards the base of the petiole, on the rachis, and sometimes on petiolules. They are less common in caesalpinioids, although they may be represented by tufts of hairs (Pascal et al. 2000), and still less common in Faboideae, although they have originated several times even there (Marazzi et al. 2014). Marazzi et al. (2012) suggested that in a clade making up most of Caesalpinioideae (<i>Gleditsia</i>/<i>Chamaechrista</i>/the mimosoid clade) and dated to  63 or more m.y. - the origin of extrafloral nectaries could be thought of as a facilitating "deep homology" manifest in the numerous subsequent independent acquisitions of the nectaries. Interactions between the nature of rhizobial infections, nectaries, and the effects of herbivory are discussed above. </p>

 
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are also more intimate ant/legume associations where generally but a single species of ant is involved in each association (Schemske 1983). The close association of <i>Pseudomyrmex</i> ants with some members of the old <i>Acacia</i> subgenus <i>Acacia</i> (= <i>Vachellia</i>), including the swollen-thorn
acacias such as <i>V. sphaerocephala</i>, are well known, and in <i>V. erioloba</i>, at least, two or even more species of ants are commonly found inhabiting different domatia on the one plant (Campbell et al. 2015; Chomicki &amp; Renner 2015 for dates). The plant provides protein-rich Beltian bodies at the ends of each leaflet (the leaves have many leaflets, even for <i>Acacia</i> s.l.) as food for the ants, and swollen stipular thorns serve as their homes (Janzen 1967b, 1974b; Webber &amp; McKey 2009). The ants also take nectar from extrafloral nectaries. Interestingly, the nectar is sucrose-free unlike normal extrafloral nectar, invertase in the nectar breaking the sucrose down into glucose and fructose (Kautz et al. 2009). Furthermore, the invertase the ants need to break down the sucrose is inhibited by chitinase, a major protein in the extrafloral nectar (Heil et al. 2014). Complex interactions between protease inhibitors in the plant and proteases in insects may help deter other than the mutualist ants from eating the Beltian bodies (Orono-Tamayo et al. 2013; see Rubin and Moreau 2016 for interaction between molecular evolution and mutualism in <i>Pseudomyrmex</i>). The ages of <i>Pseudomyrmex</i> and the main clde of <i>Vachellia</i> that it inhabits is about the same, ca 5 m.y.a.,  and there seems to have been but a single gain of domatia there (Chomicki et al. 2015;  Chomicki &amp; Renner 2015). However, there have been at least 15 more gains of similar ant domatia in the New World legumes <i>Platymiscium</i> (Dalbergieae - ?4: see Chomicki &amp; Renner 2015, origins ca 13.4 m.y., 6.1 m.y., and more recently) and <i>Tachigali</i> ("Caes.": 9; see Fonseca 1994), and evolution of ant and plant seems to have been more or less contemporaneous in the latter, but with later bouts of colonization by the same and different ant clades (Chomicki et al. 2015). Perversely, species of <i>Acacia</i> with low nectar rewards are derived from those with higher rewards, and species that offer only low rewards are often colonized by exploiter ants that do not defend the plant (Heil et al. 2009), while specialized ant/domatia systems can be exploited by parasitic ants recently derived from generalist ant/plant relatives (Chomicki et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are other examples of close ant/plant relationships in Fabaceae (McKey 1989 for a list). In the common African  <i>Leonardoxa africana</i> (Detarioideae) a third party, an ascomycete, is central to the relationship. Nitrogen from the ants initially moved more into the fungus than the plant (Defossez et al. 2010), then ant larvae ate the fungi (Blatrix et al. 2012: see also similar associations in the neotropical <i>Tachigali</i> (Caesalpinioidieae); over time the nitrogen became distributed about equally among all three partners (Defossez et al. 2010). For plant-ant signalling in this association, see Vittecoq et al. (2011); Brouat et al. (2001) thought that the size and shape of the prostoma, the more or less unlignified area of the stem through which the ant entered the plant, could in some cases be linked with comparable attributes of the head of the ant involved in the association. Bacteria live off colony debris are in turn eaten by rhabditid nematodes that are possibly in turn eaten by ants living in the southeast Asian <i>Saraca thaipingensis</i> (Detarioideae: Maschwitz et al. 2016).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bacteria and N-Fixation.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Many Fabaceae have a close association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria which grow inside irregular, pinkish-coloured nodules on the roots (Sprent 2009 and Sprent et al. 2017 for summaries), the &alpha;-proteobacterium <i>Rhizobium</i> is the best-known genus involved. Nodulation is especially widespread in Faboideae and the mimosoid clade, but it is sporadic in more basal Caesalpinioideae, occuring in <i>Chamaecrista</i> and several other genera (Manzanilla &amp; Bruneau 2014). In general, nodulation is very common indeed outside the tropics, less common in the humid tropics (Sprent et al. 2013). Although most Faboideae are nodulators (Sprent 2000, 2001, 2007) and the nodulating <i>Swartzia</i> (derived nodule morphology) and immediate relatives may form a clade sister to the rest, or most of the rest, of the subfamily (see below: Ireland
et al. 2000; Pennington et al. 2000; Lavin et al. 2005), Faboideae in other clades basal to that including the bulk of the subfamily do not nodulate. Root nodule morphology may help delimit groups of genera in Faboideae (Wojciechowski 2003; Sprent et al. 2013); nodule morphology is independent of the particular bacterium involved and is controlled by the plant (Angus et al. 2013; Agapakis et al. 2014). Some aquatic legumes in both the mimosoid clade (<i>Neptunia</i>) and Faboideae (<i>Aeschynomene</i>) form stem nodules, albeit sometimes also associated with adventitious roots. In <i>Aeschynomene</i> the ability to form such nodules has evolved more than once, and members of a clade of this genus can form nodules with <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> even though they have lost Nod-genes (see below: the bacteria enter via cracks in the stem), furthermore, several strains of <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> are involved and some are photosynthetic (Chaintreuil et al. 2013); for more on <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, see below. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Rhizobia fix nitrogen only when in association with their host, and one of the components of the cofactor of the nitrogenase which actually fixes the nitrogen comes from the host legume (Hakoyama et al. 2009). Nodule formation is initiated by the exudation of flavonoids, isoflavonoids and other bacterial attractants by the host and the infection of a root hair by a bacterium. The plant may also become infected through cracks in the epidermis, perhaps the plesiomorphic condition, as in Faboideae-Dalbergieae and -Genisteae  (Cannon et al. 2010; Vessey et al. 2004; Okubo et al. 2012; Terpolilli et al. 2012; Chaintreuil et al. 2013); nodulation near lateral roots also occurs (Sprent et al. 2013 for a summary). Infection in <i>Sesbania rostrata</i> is both through cracks and via root hairs, the particular mode depending on the interaction of ethylene and water conditions in the soil (Oldroyd &amp; Downie 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Nodule formation often involves the production of Nod factors (NFs) by the bacterium, although in a few nodule-forming &alpha;-proteobacteria such as the photosynthetic <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> canonical <i>nodABC</i> genes are absent (Giraud et al. 2007). NFs are lipochito-oligosaccharides (LCOs), made up of a chain of 3-5 N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units, variously substituted and with a 16-20 C fatty acid attached. However, Gourion et al. (2015) emphasize the fact that NFs are not always involved in nodulation and that during infection there may be cell death as in the hypersensitive response to pathogens, and that in general, modulation of the normal immunity defence reactions of the legume are important in the initial establishment of the plant/bacterium association. There is a common symbiosis pathway in both baterial and mycorrhizal pathways, with a number of genes being shared by the two  (Kawaharada et al. 2017 for details). Initial stages of nodulation are accompanied by the reprogramming of the host legume's genome, and the expression levels of large numbers of genes changes, including the repression of genes which might be involved in defence  (Benedito et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The plesiomorphic infection morphology is that of persistent fixation threads, where the N-fixing bacterioids are retained within cell-wall bounded structures, two or more bacterioids per cell, and the nodules are long-lived (see also <i>Parasponia</i> [Cannabaceae]). More derived is the absence of fixation threads, rather, there are infection threads, the bacteria being released into membrane-bounded symbiosomes (Sprent et al. 2017), also the bacteria-infected cells may undergo mitosis, there is a single bacterioid per cell, and the nodule has a short life span (de Faria &amp; Sprent 1995; Corby 1988: survey of nodule morphology; Sprent 2005: nodule distribution, see also J. J. Doyle 1994, 1998; J. J. Doyle et al. 1997; Lavin et al. 2001; Oono et al. 2010; Terpolilli et al. 2012). Thus  <i>Lotus</i> has determinate nodules and infection is usually by root hairs [desmodioid nodules] - J. J. Doyle (2011). Infection threads are invaginations of the wall of the root hair - and how these threads develop is not that dissimilar from how root hairs develop - through which bacteria reach the apoplastic area beneath the epidermis. The bacteria synthesize exopolysaccharide, <i>Epr</i>3 being the receptor gene in the plant, and they move down the thread in part by successive division, and the development of the thread results from  quasi-independent events in successive cells, so reaching more deeply into the root, the thread eventually branching in the nodule primordium, the bacteria being released (for details, see Gage 2004; Oldroyd and Downie 2008; Kawaharada et al 2017). Persistent infection threads and nodules of indeterminate growth are found in "Caesalpinioideae" and also in some Faboideae like <i>Pisum</i> and <i>Vicia</i> (Naisbitt &amp; Sprent 1992; Rae et al. 1992). There the bacteria eventually move  by endocytosis into the nodule cell in which they will reside; one or a few bacteria (now known as bacteroids) are enclosed by a host-derived membrane, the whole forming an organelle-like symbiosome (Rae et al. 1992; Gage 2003; Streng et al. 2011, summary; Sprent et al. 2013). Symbiosomes are formed in cells that are no longer meristematic, the meristem continuing to produce a supply of cells that are serially infected by the persistent infection threads. In determinate nodules such as occur in <i>Phaseolus</i>, but which are usually found in tropical legumes (Gage 2003), symbiosomes form in cells of the nodule meristem, and transmission is by cell division (Rae et al. 1992). In <i>Medicago</i>, at least, repeated endoreduplication of the host cell is needed for invasion of the bacterium to occur and the whole nodulation process to be effective (Maluszynska et al. 2013 and references). The nodules are anatomically rather like stems in having peripheral vascular bundles, the bacteria being in the pith (Franche et al. 1998), however, nodule origination occurs where lateral roots develop, at least in Faboideae (op den Camp et al. 2011). Bacteroid differentiation is either reversible, little morphological change occurring, or non-reversible. In the latter case the bacteroids become swollen and there is only one per cell, but N-fixation is more efficient than that by non-swollen bacteroids (Oono &amp; Denison 2010; Sprent et al. 2013). The plant produces nodule-specific cysteine-rich [NCR] antimicrobial peptides, and these cause endoreduplication of the bacterial genome, and the bacteria stop growing and become dependent on the host for many basic activities; they have been called ammoniaplasts and are effectively plant organelles Gage 2004; Terpolilli et al. 2012). This apparently irreversible process seems to have evolved several times (Oono et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is a relatively small chromosome-born "symbiosis island" that can be exchanged by lateral gene transfer as a unit (e.g. Agapakis et al. 2014; see also Orme&ntilde;o-Orillo et al. 2013 for lateral transfer) among bacteria and that enables nodulation to develop, although not all nodulation genes may occur on the island (Sullivan &amp; Ronson 1998; J. J. Doyle 1998), amd there are also similar mobile plasmids the exchange of which can cause symbionts to become pathogens and vice versa (Sprent et al. 2017). Particular legumes may select particular bacterial variants for nodulation, yet all the bacteria may have similar symbiosis islands (Parker 2012). Several <i>nod</i> genes aggregate to form the <i>nodABCIJ</i> operon that is common in &alpha;-rhizobia (Aoki et al. 2013, see also below). Such an aggregation of genes enables bacteria to become endosymbionts in a single step (Maclean et al. 2007). In Ethiopia there is both vertical transmission of these gene complexes as well as horizontal transmission of symbiosis islands from introduced strains of nodulating bacteria to native strains (Aserse et al. 2012; see also  Beukes et al. 2016). In eastern North America legume hosts select for particular <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> strains, and independent of this particular variants of the symbiosis island are exchanged between the different bacteria (Parker 2012). Strains of <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> may be metabolically quite different, conversely, quite different legume bacterial symbionts may share more genes than <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i>, for example, shares with the closely related but non-symbiotic <i>Agrobacterium</i> (Maclean et al. 2007).  See also Hirsch and LaRue (1997), Couzigou et al. (2012) and Chaintreuil et al. (2013) for the complex origin of the nodule developmental pathway. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Further complicating the issue, rhizobia do not form resting spores, and how they persist in the soil is unknown - perhaps in biofilms (Hirsch 2010)? It is often suggested that genes involved in nodulation moved from &alpha;- to &szlig;-proteobacteria, but it appears that <i>nodIJ</i> genes, at least, may have evolved following a gene duplication in &szlig;-proteobacteria and then moved and became part of the <i>nodABCIJ</i> operon (Aoki et al. 2013). Finally, it has recently been realized that strains of <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> are <u>the</u> dominating bacteria in pine forests across North America, and although they are unable to fix nitrogen,  they seem to be able to metabolize aromatic carbon sources (VanInsberghe et al. (2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Details of the evolution of nodulation in Fabaceae are still not well understood (J. J. Doyle 2013). In Faboideae, nodulation involves the cooption of genes (originally involved in lateral root origination) after a genome duplication event ca 54 m.y.a. or  (67-)63.7, 57(-56) m.y.a. (op den Camp et al. 2011; Q.-G. Li et al. 2013; Vanneste et al. 2014a, 2014b). This happened after the divergence of Faboideae from N-fixing clades such as <i>Chamaecrista</i> which do not have this duplication  and probably form nodules in a different way (Cannon et al. 2010), the nodules probably being plesiomorphic in morphology (Vanneste et al. 2014b). Indeed, the ability to nodulate has been acquired several times within the family. Manzanilla and Bruneau (2012: but c.f. Figs 2 and 3) discuss the distribution of nodules in the Caesalpinioideae; they are quite widespread there, although more so in the mimosoid area.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Many nodulating bacteria in legumes are members of the proteobacteria &alpha;-2 subclass, but they do not form a monophyletic group, and several "species" are involved; <i>Agrobacterium</i> (crown gall tumour) and others are also members of this group (J. J. Doyle 1998; Sprent 2001). <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, also associated with Fabaceae both in Australia and Africa, is very diverse with 15 or so main clades (the number is increasing), although many species lack names (Stepkowski et al. 2012; Beukes et al. 2016 and references), and there is substantial temperate/tropical differentiation in the bacteria (Stepkowski et al. 2012). Other important N-fixing bacteria associated with Fabaceae include <i>Burkholderia</i> and relatives, which are &szlig;-proteobacteria not at all close to <i>Rhizobium</i>. These are quite common in the tropics, and can tolerate alkaline conditions (Sprent 2007; Angus et al. 2013). Not all fix nitrogen, for instance, some are human pathogens, but those that are effective nitrogen-fixing symbionts form two groups, one involved in symbioses with  New World <i>Mimosa</i> and the mimosoid clade and with the <i>nod</i> and <i>nif</i> genes on plasmids, the other, <i>B. tuberum</i>, nodulating African Faboideae-Crotalarieae and -Phaseoleae and with the <i>nod</i> and <i>nif</i> genes on the chromosomes (Bontemps et al. 2010; Agapakis et al. 2014). Other &szlig;-proteobacteria form nodules, albeit ineffective, with the mimosoid clade (Moulin et al. 2001; Sprent 2002; Elliott et al. 2007 and references), and some are even pathogenic, but these rarely nodulate. Surprisingly, a <i>Burkholderia</i> growing on <i>Solanum</i> was able to form nodules and fix nitrogen when on <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> (Mart&iacute;nez-Aguilar et al. 2013).  Sprent et al. (2013, 2017) summarise the relationships of the 14 bacterial genera known to be able to nodulate legumes; see above for the timing of evolution of these associations.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bacteria that form associations with Fabaceae are mostly  alphaproteobacteria (Sprent et al. 2017), although a single plant may form associations with more than one species of bacteria, and these may be members of the two main groups just mentioned (Sprent et al. 2013 and references). Symbiont specificity tends to be greatest in the IRLC clade (Faboideae), although genera like <i>Astragalus</i> are exceptions (Howard &amp; Wojciechowski 2006; Sprent et al. 2017). At least some pioneer legumes form nodules with a variety of bacteria, thus perhaps enhancing their success as colonizing species (Behm et al. 2014 for references), although legumes associated with rhizobia spread into non-native habitats less readily than do legumes lacking this association, suggestiong that appropriate bacteria can be lacking (Simonsen et al. 2017). while in Mimoseae exactly which bacteria form associations  varies according to soil conditions (Sprent et al. 2017).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A number of species of <i>Astragalus</i> in North America are hyperaccumulators of selenium, which is stored as &#947-glutamyl-methyselenocysteine; this seems to be associated with nodulation (Alford et al. 2014: see also above).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Venkatheshwaran et al. (2012) discuss a mutation that improves nuclear calcium signalling at an early stage in the development of symbioses (for which, see Barker et al. 2017)  - IRLC clade only (<i>Lotus</i>, <i>Medicago</i>)?</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fungi.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are important fungus-legume interactions. Thus in the mimosoid clade (phyllodinous <i>Acacia</i>, <i>Senegalia</i>), Faboideae such as <i>Aldina</i>, <i>Gleditsia</i>, a group of five genera around <i>Mirbelia</i>, and in particular Detarioideae, are ECM plants, but only very rarely also AM (e.g. Sprent &amp; James 2007; S. E. Smith &amp; Read 2008; B&acirc; et al. 2011a, b; M. E. Smith et al. 2011; Bennett et al. 2017: see above). In the ECM associations of three species (two <i>Dicymbe</i>, <i>Aldina</i>, Detarioideae and Faboideae respectively) dominating in New World forests there were over one hundred species of mostly basidiomycete fungi involved (M. E. Smith et al. 2011). ECM networks, as in <i>Dicymbe</i> forests in Guyana and in <i>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei</i> forests in Cameroon, can be complex, the network being established as the seed germinates (McGuire 2007b; Micha&euml;lla Ebenye et al. 2017).  Interestingly, ECM fungi from Fabaceae and those on <i>Uapaca</i> (Phyllanthaceae) group together (Tedersoo et al. 2014a), perhaps because the hosts may grow together. For further details of ECM fungi and Fabaceae, see Ecology &amp; Physiology above and <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#EctomycorrhizalPlants" target="home">clade asymmetries</a>, however, little is known about mimosoid:fungus relationships (<i>Acacia</i> can be AM or ECM - Hayman 1986). AM fungi are known from several N-fixing Fabaceae-Faboideae (Hayman 1986), and have been found in root nodules in several species (but not in <i>Lupinus</i>, see also above), although their importance there is unclear (Scheublin &amp; van der Heijden 2006). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some species of <i>Lupinus</i> have lost the ability to form AM associations, although they still have the conserved genes  that are part of the symbiosis toolkit but have non-symbiotic roles (Delaux et al. 2014, see also above).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In <i>Oxytropis kansuensis</i> the toxic indolizidine alkaloid, swainsonine, is synthesised by the endophyte <i>Undifilum</i> (inc. <i>Embellisia</i>), an imperfect stage of Pleosporaceae, an ascomycete  (Pryor et al. 2009; see also Reyna et al. 2012). Swainsonine is also found in some species of <i>Astragalus</i> and of <i>Swainsona</i> itself (Ralphs et al. 2008). In North America these species with swainsonine are often called "locoweeds", and they cause a serious, sometimes fatal, disease in cattle that eat them. Swainsonine was first found to be synthesized by the bacterium <i>Rhizoctonia leguminicola</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Rusts show interesting patterns of distribution on Fabaceae.  <i>Uromyces</i> is found predominantly on herbaceous Faboideae, but also on <i>Bauhinia</i> and one or two other non-Faboideae), while <i>Ravenelia</i> is found on woody members of the family, "Caesalpinioideae" (but not <i>Bauhinia</i>) and especially the mimosoid clade (Savile 1976, 1979a, b; El-Gazzar 1979). In some species of <i>Ravenelia</i> the teliospores, thick-walled spores in which nuclear fusion and then meiosis occur, are aggregated into groups, and these telial heads may mimic the groups of pollen grains (polyads) that are common in the mimosoid clade. Stingless <i>Trigona</i> bees pick up both telial heads and polyads as they forage for pollen, so helping disperse the fungus. Interestingly, <i>Ravenelia</i> is only very rarely found on  <i>Acacia</i>, and the distributions of rusts, acacias and trigonid bees all break at about Wallace's Line; thus <i>Ravenelia</i> is not native to Australia, <i>Acacia</i> s. str. is centred on Australia, etc. (El-Gazzar 1979; Savile 1979b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bacteria and Fungi together.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fabaceae include most ECM plants that also fix nitrogen, a rather uncommon combination (for <i>Alnus</i> [Betulaceae], see Walker et al. 2013), although relatively little is known about their eco-physiology. Endomycorrhizal Fabaceae  are commonly associated with N-fixing bacteria (B&acirc; et al. 2011b). The establishment of endomycorrhizal associations and a variety of aspects of the nodulation process starting with root hair curling are connected and can be linked to an autophagy related kinase, precursors for all these activities being produced by autophagy (Estrada-Navarrete et al. 2016: <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> Although most Fabaceae have once- or twice-compound leaves, leaflets that are opposite or alternate and with entire margins, and pulvini associated with leaves and leaflets, there is extensive variation on this theme. Thus palmate leaves occur in <i>Lupinus</i>, serrate leaflet margins in <i>Cicer</i>, <i>Medicago</i>, etc., and unifolioliate leaves  are scattered throughout the family. A number of Faboideae (e.g. <i>Vicia</i>, <i>Pisum</i>) are tendrillar vines, the tendrils being modified terminal leaflets; in <i>Lathyrus aphaca</i> the photosynthetic function of the leaf is taken over by the large stipules, the rest of the leaf being an unbranched tendril, while <i>L. nissolia</i> lacks tendrils and has a phyllodinous leaf (see Kenicer et al. 2005 for a phylogeny). In some taxa compound leaves are reduced to a single more or less connate pair of leaflets, as in <i>Bauhinia</i>, named after the botanical brothers Caspar and Jean Bauhin, and <i>Cercis</i> (Owens 2000). The leaves of <i>Tachigali</i> have continuous growth like those of <i>Chisocheton</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In general, angiosperm leaf development is associated with the activity of the <i>KNOX1</i> gene, and this is also true of plants with compound leaves incuding many Fabaceae. However, in the IRL clade (Faboideae) the <i>KNOX1</i> gene is not - or rather differently - expressed in the developing leaves, while <i>FLO</i>/<i>LFY</i> genes, normally floral meristem identity genes, are expressed both in the leaves and in the flowers (Hofer et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2008; Peng et al. 2011; Townsley &amp; Sinha 2012). Interestingly, the leaves of the IRL clade lack pulvini, which are present in nearly all other Fabaceae (Champagne et al. 2007; Rosin &amp; Kraemer 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In <i>Acacia</i> s. str. (the old subgenus <i>Phyllodinae</i>), the leaves of the mature plant are much modified undivided structures flattened at right angles to the plane of flattening of a normal lamina; they are often called phyllodes. A long-standing question has been, what "is" this <i>Acacia</i> leaf? In the early development of normal leaves of Fabaceae two rows of adaxial meristems produce the leaflets/pinnae, and these become lateral in position by secondary reorientation. In the phyllodes of <i>Acacia</i> there is a single, broader adaxial meristem that develops into the entire leaf (Kaplan 1980); there is no reorientation, hence the plane of flattening of the phyllode.  Complicating the issue, in species like <i>A. verticillata</i> these phyllodes are densely set along the stem, some are associated with stipules and buds and have an extrafloral nectary, but others are simply flattened, needle-like processes (Kaplan 1980); the relationship between the two kinds of phyllodes is unclear. See also Rutishauser (1999) for the morphology of whorled leaves in <i>Acacia</i>, and Rutishauser and Sattler (1986) and Sattler et al. (1988) for the development of <i>A. longipedunculata</i> leaves, where there are only seven traces and 1-3(-4) axillary buds per whorl of up to 27 phyllodes, and colleters and other structures are also involved.  Gardner et al. (2008) summarized of the history of this controversy. Seedlings and regeneration shoots can also have normal-looking once or twice compound leaves as well as intermediates. Pasquet-Kok et al. (2010) looked at the complex functional aspects of this switch from regular leaves to phyllodes during the development of the plant in the Hawaiian <i>A koa</i>, and they found i.a. that phyllodes were more drought tolerant and regular leaves might grow faster and tolerate shade better.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some species of <i>Mimosa</i> and other genera have leaves that are sensitive to touch, stimulus transmission occurring as membrane depolarisation is propagated down the petiole and along the stem (Volkov &amp; Markin 2014 for a summary); folding of the leaf is caused by tugor changes in the cells of the pulvini at the bases of the leaf and leaflets (for the anatomy of the pulvinus, which has an endodermis, see Rodrigues &amp; Machado 2007). Simon et al. (2011) suggest that sensitive leaves have evolved ca six times in <i>Mimosa</i> alone, although a full understanding of the evolution of this feature depends on more extensive studies on this and related phenomena in legume leaves. Thus in <i>Albizzia</i> (<i>Samanea</i>) <i>saman</i>, there are similar movements as the leaflets fold towards the evening when the light is failing, or just when there is heavy cloud cover, this behaviour being responsible (in some tellings of the tale) for the name of this plant, the rain tree. In <i>Desmodium gyrans</i> the single pair of lateral leaflets move intermittently without being touched, the speed of movement increasing with the temperature. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Nodal anatomy is more variable than might be thought - <i>Ulex</i> (= <i>Genista</i> s.l.) has 1:1 nodes, while the pattern of change in nodal anatomy during ontogeny in <i>Vicia</i> is complex, and in adult plants the lateral bundles sometimes arise a full internode below the node they innervate (Kupicha 1975).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Economic Importance.</b> Weeden (2007) discusses the diversity of genetic changes involved in domestication of legumes. For information on the domestication of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), common bean <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>), the azuki bean (<i>Vigna angularis</i>) and relatives, see papers in <i>Ann. Bot.</i> 100(5). 2007, and for these taxa and lentil (<i>Lens culinaris</i>), see Fuller (2007). For the peanut, <i>Arachis hypogea</i>, see Krapovikas and Gregory (1994), for its domestication, see Dillehay et al. (2007) and for its phylogeny, see Friend et al. (2010), for the domestication of the lima bean, <i>Phaseolus lunatus</i>, see Serrano-Serrano et al. (2010), for much information on alfafa, <i>Medicago sativa</i>, see Small (2011), and for the relatives of soybean, see Sherman-Broyles et al. (2014).</b>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> A whole genome duplication in Faboideae seems to have occurred prior to the divergence of Dalbergieae (Bertoli et al. 2009; Cannon et al. 2014: <i>Copaifera</i>; see also Young et al. 2011), although exactly where this duplication is to be placed is unclear and subsequent chromosomal rearrangements have been extensive (Murat et al. 2015b: <i>Glycine</i>, <i>Lotus</i>); see above for dates. There may be additional duplications  somewhere in Cercidoideae and in the ancestor of [<i>Chamaecrista</i> + the mimosoid clade] (e.g. Young et al. 2011), although at this stage it is not clear exactly where they occurred and what immediate evolutionary consequences there might be for the clades involved (Cannon et al. 2014: Swartzieae s.l. not sampled). Jiang et al. (2013) examine the fate of duplicated genes in <i>Glycine max</i>, interestingly, there is no evidence of fractionation bias or genome dominance associated with the duplication in <i>Glycine</i>, suggesting it was an autoploid event, while there was evidence of the former, at least, for a duplication in <i>Medicago</i>, suggesting alloploidy there (Garsmeur et al. 2013). Overall, however, there is little polyploidy in Faboideae, and there has been extensive reduction in chromosome numbers after the duplication.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Transmission of plastids may be biparental (Corriveau &amp; Coleman 1988). There have been major changes in chloroplast organisation in Faboideae in particular that, apart from their intrinsic interest, provide a considerable amount of phylogenetic structure. The chloroplast genome is notably labile, both in terms of sequence (Kua et al. 2012) and structure (see Martin et al. 2014 for a summary). Most Faboideae have a 50kb inversion in the <i>trn</i>L intron in the large single-copy region of their chloroplast genome, however, taxa like Swartzieae, <i>Cladrastis</i>, and a few others, lack this inversion (J. J. Doyle et al. 1996, 1997; Pennington et al. 2001; Wojciechowski et al. 2004). The loss of the chloroplast inverted repeat characterises a largely temperate, herbaceous and very speciose group, the IRLC clade (see above: Wojciechowski 2003 and references). Temperate members of the IRLC clade lack the <i>clp</i>P intron, while the <i>rps</i>12 intron has been lost from all members of the clade examined except <i>Wisteria</i>, <i>Callerya</i> and <i>Afgekia</i> - but not <i>Glycyrrhiza</i> (Jansen et al. 2008; Wojciechowski et al. 2008; see also Saski et al. 2007; Cai et al. 2008; c.f. Sabir et al. 2014 in part). <i>Pisum</i> and <i>Lathyrus</i> have diffuse centromeres/holocentric chromosomes, and this follows a duplication of the <i>CenH3</i> gene (Neumann et al. 2015). Genome evolution in taxa that lack the inverted repeat has also been considerable (Magee et al. 2010; Sabir et al. 2014; Schwarz et al. 2015). <i>Desmodium</i> and possibly related genera (MILL) have also lost the <i>rps</i>12 intron (it has moved to the nucleus)  (Doyle et al. 1995; Bailey et al. 1997; Jansen et al. 2008). ORF 184 has been lost many times, especially in the MILL clade, and <i>acc</i>D (= ORF 512, <i>zpf</i>A) has also been lost (Doyle et al. 1995). Both the <i>rps</i>16 and <i>ycf</i>4 genes are lost in many Faboideae (Doyle et al. 1995; Jansen et al. 2007), the former being absent in all members of the IRL clade, but also being lost in four other clades  in Faboideae (Schwarz et al. 2015).  Bertoli et al. (2009) link genome regions that are variable with the presence of retrotransposons.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The mimosoid plastome is about 10,000 kb larger than that of the Faboideae listed (no caesalpinioids were mentioned), partly because of the extension of the inverted repeat and partly because of tandem repeat expansions (Dugas et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Cytisus purpureus</i> forms a well-known graft hybrid with <i>Laburnum  anagyroides</i>
(+ <i>Laburnocytisus adamii</i>; see Herrmann 1951 for another example); the epidermis alone is <i>Cytisus</i> tissue, and any seeds, being derived from cells from deeper layers, will give <i>Laburnum</i> plants. However, the graft hybrid often breaks down, resulting in branches that are pure <i>Laburnum anagyroides</i> or pure <i>Cytisus purpureus</i>.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The diversity of secondary metabolites in Fabaceae, perhaps especially in Faboideae, is remarkable (see also above). For instance, about 28% of all known flavonoids and about 95% of the isoflavonoid aglycone structures - over 1,000 alone - have been found there, and isoflavonoids are restricted to Faboideae. Isoflavonoids are both phytoalexins  involved in plant defence and may also play a role in nodulation (Hegnauer &amp; Grayer-Barkmeijer 1993; Reynaud et al. 2004). Flavonoids lacking the 5-hydroxy group are characteristic of Fabaceae (Seigler 2003), but I do not know at what level they are apomorphic. Pea albumin, a small sulphur-rich peptide involved in food storage and also with insecticidal properties, is known only from Faboideae,  and the albumin-1 gene may be a synapomorphy for the [hologalegina + millettioid] clade (Louis et al. 2007); it is not to be found in some/all robinioids, and has been transferred at least twice to parasites (<i>Cuscuta</i>, <i>Orobanche</i> and relatives - Y. Zhang et al. 2013).  Despite the diversity of secondary metabolites in the family, correlation of metabolites with clades is for the most part poor (Wink 2013). Colville et al. (2015) linked the presence of homoglutathione to the genome duplication in Faboideae and to the Old World clade; the function of homoglutathione, unlike that of glutathione, was unclear. The Australian <i>Gastrolobium</i> (Mirbelieae) produces the toxic sodium monofluoroacetate (Chandler et al. 2001). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Characters of caesalpinioid woods include rays that are usually more than 20 cells tall, presence of silica bodies, and axial canals (Evans et al. 2006); I do not know how these fit on to the current tree. Some of the mimosoid clade and Faboideae have leaves that are rich in silica (Westbrook et al. 2009). Colleters have been reported from "Caesalpinioideae", especially <i>Chamaecrista</i> (Coutinho et al. 2015 and refs); <i>Bauhinia</i> has "staminodial" structures at the base of the ovary (Endress 2008c) that may also have something to do with colleters.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The parts of the flowers of most Fabaceae develop in unusual sequences, often sepals-carpels-petals-outer stamens-inner stamens, and there are other distinctive features of their development (e.g. Champagne et al. 2007; Feng et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2008). For variation in general patterns of floral development, see Prenner and Klitgaard (2008b); they emphasized the diversity of developmental patterns even within the corolla whorl, thus although both <i>Duparquetia</i> and Faboideae have the adaxial petal in the outermost position, yet the two get there by developmentally different pathways.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Floral variation is considerable in members of the old Caesalpinioideae, and Prenner and Klitgaard (2008b: p. 1363; see also Zimmerman et al. 2013b). When there is the complete loss of individual floral structures in evolution, floral development can be greatly changed (Tucker 1988, 2000), although, as Bruneau et al. (2014) noted, in Detarioideae organs in one whorl can be lost without much affecting the development of the rest of the flower - as with the complete loss of a calyx member in <u>Duparquetia</u> and <i>Goniorrhachis</i> (Prenner &amp; Klitgaard 2008b; Prenner &amp; Cardoso 2016). For additional information about floral development in "caesalpinioids", see also Tucker (1996a, b, 2001, 2002b, c, 2003c [all Detarioideae]), Tucker (1998) and Zimmerman et al. (2013a, b), all Dialiinae - complete organ loss common,  Mansano and Teixeira (2008: <i>Lecointea</i> clade), Pedersoli et al. (2010: <i>Copaifera</i>, Detarioideae), and Bruneau et al. (2014: Detarioideae). Prenner and Cardoso (2016) note that in Detarioideae a 4-merous calyx may be the result of fusion of two members or, in <i>Goniorrhachis</i>, the absolute suppression of one member. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the adaxial sepal member in the mimosoid clade, see Ram&iacute;rez and Tucker (1990); they describe a variety of developmental pathways that result in the connate calyx of that subfamily. For more floral development in the mimosoid clade, see Gemmeke (1982); stamens may develop centripetally on five main primordia. De Barros et al. (2017: useful tables) describe floral development of taxa in and close to the mimosoid clade. The cochlear-descending calyx aestivation, helically-initiated androecium, etc., of <i>Calliandra</i> s. str., are distinctive within the mimosoid clade (Prenner 2004b). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Prenner (2013a, b: esp. androecium) surveyed floral development in Faboideae; he (Prenner 2004c) suggested that there was a slight asymmetry in the early development of the androecium (the adaxial median stamen is initiated slightly off the median axis) in more "basal" Faboideae and also in some "Caesalpinioideae". Variation in floral morphology and development is considerable in clades of "basal" Faboideae, e.g. Cardoso et al. (2013a, b). Pennington et al. (2000) discussed floral evolution in these Faboideae, some of which like <i>Swartzia</i> have flowers with very derived morphologies; <i>Swartzia</i> lacks petal rudiments, but these are to be found in <i>Amburana</i>, of the ADA clade (Leite et al. 2015). Androecial initiation in <i>Swartzia</i> can be both centripetal and centrifugal (Tucker 2003b). The pattern of initiation of the sepals and stamens is variable, by no means always being unidirectional (e.g. Prenner 2004a; de Chiara Mo&ccedil;o &amp; de Araujo Mariath 2009; Leite et al. 2015). Floral variation in basal Faboideae is quite extensive - for instance, although the flower of <i>Petaladenium</i> is "faboid", the keel petals are not fused and there are no  locking devices on the petals - suggesting that there was an early "experimental" phase in floral evolution in this clade (Tucker 1993; leite et al. 2014; Prenner et al. 2015). Prenner (2013b) found that petal initiation in <i>Abrus</i>, as in some other Faboideae, was simultaneous. There are CA primordia in the flower, A initiation is bidirectional, and there is overlap in the timing of C, A, and G initiation is members of the ILR clade (Naghiloo &amp; Dadpour 2010). The flowers of some Amorpheae have a stemonozone rather than a hypanthium, i.e. the staminal tube is adnate to the petals (McMahon &amp; Hufford 2002). For floral and inflorescence morphology, especially in Faboideae-Loteae, see Sokoloff et al. (2007a). Klitg&aring;rd et al. (2013) found that polysymmetric flowers, sometimes with long, linear petals, had evolved ca four times in the <i>Pterocarpus</i> clade alone, which otherwise has monosymmetric papilionoid flowers. The calyx of <i>Parkia multijuga</i> (the mimosoid clade) is quite monosymmetric, especially in bud (Pedersoli &amp; Texeira 2015). See also Mansano et al. (2002: Swartzieae s.l.), Song et al. (2011: <i>Clianthus</i>), Paulino et al. (2011: <i>Indigofera</i>, 2013: <i>Swartzia</i>). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Guinet (1981a) outlined some major patterns of pollen variation in the family. Hesse (1986) noted that both <i>Bauhinia</i> and <i>Cercis</i> - and <i>Caesalpinia</i> and <i>Delonix</i> - had pollen-connecting threads made up of something other than sporopollenin. For pollen variation in "Caesalpinioideae", see Graham and Barker (1981), Banks et al. (2003) and Banks and Rudall (2016) and references, also Banks and Klitgaard (2000: Detarioideae), Banks and Lewis (2009: <i>Dimorphandra</i> group), and Banks et al. (2013, 2014: Cercidoideae, diverse); Cercidoideae and Detarioideae are particularly variable, while the pollen of <i>Duparquetia</i> is unique among angiosperms (Banks et al. 2006). Many of the mimosoid clade have polyads, which vary in size and aperture number, etc. (see Guinet 1969, 1981b;  Feuer 1987; Banks et al. 2011). The recently-described <i>Afrocalliandra</i> has a 7-celled polyad (de Souza et al. 2013, also literature for mimosoid pollen); I have no idea how this develops. For polyads, anther dehiscence, etc., in some of the mimosoid clade see Teppner (2007) and Teppner and Stabentheiner (2007) and references. Aperture position in the mimosoid clade does not follow Fischer's rule (Banks et al. 2010).  Ferguson and Skvarla (1981) discuss pollen of Papilionoideae (see also Kuriakose 2007). The extensive palynological variation needs ro be  placed in the context of a full tribal-level phylogeny.</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Compared to variation in other parts of the flower, that of the gynoecium is slight: There is nearly always a single carpel with the same orientation. The style is at least sometimes hollow, although the cavity arises in various ways, including by lysigeny (Lersten 2004). The carpels may have five traces and are quite often open during development in "Caesalpinioideae", but not, apparently, in Cercidoideae, the mimosoid clade or Faboideae (Tucker &amp; Kantz 2001). The embryo sac of some Faboideae (?elsewhere) more or less protrudes into the micropyle, as in <i>Archevaletaia</i> (Maheshwari 1950). There is a great deal of variation in the development of the embryo suspensor, even within Faboideae, especially in <i>Vicia</i> where endopolyploidy in the suspensor can reach 8,000C (Lersten 1983; also Tucker 1987; Yeung &amp; Meinke 1993; Rodriguez-Pontes 2008; Endo 2012b; Shi et al. (2015: coleorhiza in some taxa?). Both a true (integumentary) endothelium and a nucellar endothelium may be present in Faboideae (Rodrigues-Pontes 2008 for discussion and references). The two recurrent vascular bundles lateral to the hilum are absent in basal Faboideae (Lackey 2009). D. L. Smith (1981) discussed cotyledon vasculature and anatomy; quite variable. For the aborting plumule in seedlings of <i>Lotus</i> and <i>Coronilla</i> and their relatives, see Dormer (1945).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> The Legume Phylogeny Working Group (2013a) provide a good summary of relationships in the family. Fabaceae are monophyletic in both molecular and morphological analyses, although support may not be strong. "Caesalpinioideae" are wildly paraphyletic at the base of Fabaceae, with the mimosoid clade and Faboideae clearly being monophyletic and separately embedded in "Caesalpinioideae". Cercidoideae, <i>Duparquetia</i>, and/or Detarioideae are all candidates for being sister to the rest of the family (Bruneau et al. 2008a, b; Cardoso et al. 2012a: <i>Duparquetia</i> not included; Legume Phylogeny Working Group 2013a).  Morphology and anatomy support this: All three lack the vestured pits that are common in the rest of the family (they are also absent in Caesalpinioideae-Cassieae). <i>Duparquetia</i> was found to be sister to Dialioideae by Herendeen et al. (2003b), while Cardoso et al. (2013b) found some support for the topology [<i>Duparquetia</i> [Cercidoideae + Detarioideae] [[Dialioideae [the mimosoid clade + Faboideae]]]. In addition to placing Cercideae as sister to the rest of Fabaceae, within the latter clade Wojciechowski et al. (2004) found that Dialioideae were sister to the remainder.  Two main clades made up the rest of the family. One includes  the mimosoid clade, to which <i>Ceratonia</i>, <i>Gleditsia</i>, etc., Caesalpinieae, Cassieae, and Cercideae (all Caesalpinioideae) were more or less successively sister taxa, and the other is made up of Faboideae; Bruneau et al. (2008a, b) found a somewhat similar set of relationships (see tree here). <i>Cercis</i> and <i>Bauhinia</i>
may be sister to all other Fabaceae (e.g. J. J. Doyle et al. 2000 and references; Bruneau et al. 2001), although they are also placed sister to Detarioideae, if sometimes with only with moderate support (Wojciechowski et al. 2004; Lavin et al. 2005; Forest et al. 2007b; Cardoso et al. 2013b;  Cannon et al. 2014: only one Detarioideae sampled). See also M. Sun et al. (2016) for relationships - they found "Caesalpinioideae" in eleven separate clades - and Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For <i>Duparquetia</i>, see Forest et al. (2002) and Tucker et al. (2002). The genus is highly derived, but although the carpel develops after the stamens are initiated, unlike other Fabaceae (Prenner &amp; Klitgaard 2008a, esp. b), this could be plesiomorphic; its pollen is also very distinctive (Banks et al. 2006).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Cercidoideae, <i>Cercis</i> is sister to all other members of the clade (Sinou et al. 2009), and within <i>Cercis</i>, <i>C. chungii</i> is sister to the rest, the North American and European species being embedded in the tree (Jia &amp; Manchester 2014). Generic limits around <i>Bauhinia</i> are discussed by Sinou et al. (2008, 2009); <i>Bauhinia</i> s. str. and immediate relatives, but not other Cercidoideae, lack the plastid <i>rpl</i>2 intron (e.g. Lai et al. 1997; Sinou et al. 2009).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Detarioideae (Bruneau 2000; Mackinder 2005: genera) show extensive loss of sepals and/or petals and/or stamens, and linked with the first two changes in particular, increase in size of the bracteoles and in stamen number (Tucker 1992b, 2000, etc.). Thus in <i>Monopetalanthus durandii</i> the flower is surrounded by bracteoles and the floral formula is K 1 (minute), C 1; A 10; <u>G 1</u>, and <i>Brachystegia glaucescens</i> also has large bracteoles, K 5 (all small), C 0; A 10; <u>G 1</u> (Tucker 2000).  Resins found in some Detarioideae contain distinctive bicylic diterpenes, and may be an apomorphy for a subgroup within the tribe (Foug&egrave;re-Danezan et al. 2007). Pollen is also extremely variable (Banks &amp; Klitgaard 2000; Banks 2003). There is amyloid in the cotyledons (Hegnauer &amp; Grayer-Barkmeijer 1993), also found in Sclerolobieae (= Tachigalieae: see Kooiman 1960; Meier &amp; Reid 1982). <i>Gigasiphon</i>, with two-ranked unifoliolate leaves, may be sister to the rest of the clade (M. Sun et al. 2016 and references). Redden et al. (2010) examined relationships in the <i>Brownea</i> clade, possible synapomorphies for it being an unchanneled leaf rachis, thread-like stipules, connate bracteoles, four sepals, and introrse anthers.   For relationships around <i>Gilbertiodendron</i>, see de la Estrella et al. (2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A clade made up of the ex-caesalpinioid Dialiinae seems well supported as sister to the rest of Fabaceae (see also Cardoso et al. 2013b); the monotypic neotropical <i>Poeppigia</i> is sister to the rest of the genera in this clade (Bruneau et al. 2008; M. Sun et al. 2016). The inflorescence is determinate, the fruit indehiscent (drupe or samara), and floral organs are often lost - for example, <i>Dialium guineense</i> has small bracteoles, and a floral formula of K 5, C 1 (small), A 2, <u>G 1</u> (Legume Phylogeny Working Group 2013a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are then two large clades.   </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>1. The mimosoid clade + some of the old Caesalpinioideae = Caesalpinioideae.</u> Mimosoideae in the old sense (= the mimosoid clade) are monophyletic, and have distinctive small polysymmetric flowers, but immediately basal to them are several clades made up of Caesalpinioideae, in which  genera like <i>Caesalpinia</i>, <i>Cassia</i>, and <i>Dimorphandra</i> have large more or less monosymmetic/asymmetric flowers. In Caesalpinioideae, the poorly-supported <i>Umtiza</i> clade may be sister to the rest. This clade includes taxa like <i>Gleditsia</i>, <i>Gymnocladus</i> and <i>Ceratonia</i>, several of which are dioecious and have smallish, greenish flowers sometimes with a poorly differentiated calyx and corolla - not plesiomorphic features (Herendeen et al. 2003a; Forest et al. 2007b; see also Redden &amp; Herendeen 2006: morphological analysis; Foug&egrave;re-Danezan et al. 2003, 2007, 2010: molecular and morphological studies; Legume Phylogeny Working Group 2013a, 2017; Cardoso et al. 2013b). Other caesalpinioids with small, more or less simultaneously-opening  flowers borne close together (e.g. <i>Dimorphandra</i>) are in this area of the tree (Luckow et al. 2003; Wojciechowski 2003; Bruneau et al. 2008a, b). They show considerable similarity to the mimosoid clade in wood anatomy (Evans et al. 2006) and also in pollen, which is rather homogeneous although nearly always in monads (Banks &amp; Lewis 2009). Genera like <i>Pentaclethra</i> are also to be included (c.f. Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. 2010b, but some confusion there?), while taxa like <i>Dinizia</i>, <i>Pachyelasma</i> and <i>Erythrophleum</i>, also with racemose inflorescences and small, more or less polysymmetric flowers with free sepals and petals (and ten stamens), were in a grade immediately basal to the mimosoid clade (Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. 2010b); there is a considerable amount of phylogenetic structure here (Kyalangalilwa et al. 2013). <i>Caesalpinia</i>, <i>Cassia</i>, and relatives are also basal to the mimosoid clade, <i>Dimorphandra</i>, <i>Peltophorum</i>, etc. (Cardoso et al. 2012c). In general, relationships between these ex-caesalpinioids remain unclear (Cardoso et al. 2012c, 2013b; Legume Phylogeny Working Group 2013a, b). In this account I have listed the major clades found by  Manzanilla and Bruneau (2012; see also ), although they examined other genera that were not included in any of the groupings above. They found that <i>Pterogyne</i> associated with Caesalpinieae in plastid analyses, but with Cassieae in nuclear analyses (Manzanilla &amp; Bruneau 2012). For relationships in this clade, see also M. Sun et al. (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For <i>Peltophorum</i> and its relatives, see Haston et al. (2005). For relationships in Caesalpinieae, see Simpson et al. (2003). Gagnon et al. (2013) discussed relationships around the old <i>Caesalpinia</i>; the genus is either poly- or paraphyletic (Manzanilla &amp; Bruneau (2012). For  phylogenetic relationships within <i>Senna</i>, see Marazzi et al. (2006), and for relationships within <i>Chamaecrista</i>, see de Souza Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o et al. (2009).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Mimosoideae s. str., the mimosoid clade, there is a large monophyletic clade, Mimoseae I, in which Ingeae, derived, with a valvate calyx and many stamens connate and forming a tube, are embedded in Acacieae (e.g. Clarke et al. 2000; Robinson &amp; Harris 2000; Miller &amp; Bayer
2000, 2001; Luckow et al. 2003; Jobson &amp; Luckow 2007; Brown 2008; Brown et al. 2008; Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. 2010b; Miller &amp; Seigler 2012; Kyalangalilwa et al. 2013). See Richardson et al. (2001b) for the  diversification of <i>Inga</i>.  The old <i>Acacia</i> subgenus <i>Acacia</i>, which includes the
bull's horn acacias, seems to be monophyletic, but <i>Acacia</i> s.l. is highly poly/paraphyletic. Murphy et al. (2000, 2003, 2010 [relationships still only moderately resolved]) and Miller et al. (2003) discuss the phylogeny of <i>Acacia</i> s. str., the old subgenus <i>Phyllodinae</i>. There was little support for basal relationships in the comprehensive analysis of Mishler et al. (2014), although this was improved in a study using complete chloroplast genome sequences (Williams et al.  2016). Brown et al. (2012) focussed on relationships of <i>Acacia</i> s. str. outside Australia. Miller and Bayer (2003) looked at relationships in <i>Vachellia</i>, the old subgenus <i>Acacia</i>, and <i>Senegalia</i>, the old subgenus <i>Aculeiferum</i> (support for the monophyly of this is weak  - Miller &amp; Seigler 2012). Kyalangalilwa et al. (2013) looked at the whole complex; there may still be clades of the old <i>Acacia</i> without names. Siegler (2003) summarized the phytochemistry of the complex, Evans et al. (2006) detailed wood anatomy, and Kergoat et al. (2007) noted what bruchids had to say about systematics of <i>Acacia</i> s.l.; see also <i>Muelleria</i> 26(1). 2008, a  special issue on <i>Acacia</i>, and also <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.worldwidewattle.com',600,500)">World Wide Wattle website</a>.  <i>Albizzia</i> is also in Mimoseae I, and it seems potentially quite polyphyletic (Kyalangalilwa et al. 2013). <i>Mimosa</i> may be monophyletic and sister to <i>Piptadenia</i> (Besseger et al. 2008); this relationships was also found by Simon et al. (2015), whose focus was on <i>Stryphnodendron</i>. Simon et al. (2011) provide an extensive phylogeny of <i>Mimosa</i>, optimizing various characters on the tree. De Souza et al. (2013) provide a comprehensive phlyogeny of <i>Calliandra</i> - largely, if not entirely, New World - and its immediate relatives.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Mimoseae II, named for convenience, make a paraphyletic grade basal to Mimoseae I. They include <i>Parkia</i>, a polyphyletic <i>Neptunia</i>, <i>Leucaena</i>, etc., as well as genera like <i>Pentaclethra</i> (Kyalangalilwa et al. 2013: see also above). Catalano et al. (2008) provide a phylogeny of the ecologically important New World genus <i>Prosopis</i>, also in this area; see also Iganci et al. (2015) for <i>Abarema</i>. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>2. Faboideae</u> are monophyletic. The following topology (simplified) aids in the discussion of relationships in Faboideae: [ADA clade, Swartzieae, etc. [<i>Cladrastis</i>, etc., [(= 50 KB inversion clade) <i>Andira</i> et al., <i>Vatairea</i> et al., Exostyleae/<i>Lecointea</i> et al., genistoids: GEN, [Amorpheae + dalbergioids = dalbergioids s.l.: DAL], [baphioids: BAPH [(= <b>N</b>on-<b>P</b>rotein <b>A</b>mino <b>A</b>cid <b>A</b>ccumulating - NPAAA - clade) mirbelioids: MIRB [[Indigofereae + millettioids: MILL] [robinioids: ROB + <b>I</b>nverted <b>R</b>epeat <b>L</b>oss <b>C</b>lade: IRLC]]]]]]], seems moderately well supported (Wojciechowski 2003; McMahon &amp; Sanderson 2006; Legume Phylogeny Working Group 2013a). The [robinioids + IRLC] clade is the hologalegina clade (see Farruggia &amp; Howard 2011 for possible nuclear markers). The tree here is based largely on Wojciechowski et al. (2004), Peters et al. (2010) and Cardoso et al. (2012c, 2013b); see also the Legume Phylogeny Working Group (2013a), McMahon and Sanderson (2006: a supermatrix analysis of 2228 species) and M. Sun et al. (2016) for further details.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Swartzieae may be sister to other Faboideae, but support is weak (Ireland
et al. 2000; Pennington et al. 2000; Lavin et al. 2005). Indeed,  Cardoso et al. (2012a, 2013b) found the well-supported [Angylocalyceae [Dipterygeae + Amburaneae]], the ADA clade, to be sister to all other Faboideae, although this position must be confirmed (see also M. Sun et al. 2016). Cardoso et al. (2013b; also M. Sun et al. 2016) found some support for a Swartzieae s.l., i.e. [Swartzieae s. str. + <i>Ateleia</i>, etc.], as sister to remaining Faboideae (see Torke &amp; Schaal 2008 for a phylogeny). For the lecointeoids (= Exostyleae), see Mansano et al. (2004) and for the vataireoids, see Cardoso et al. (2013a).   Cardoso et al. (2012a, esp. 2013b) discussed other relationships among Faboideae basal to the NPAAA clade. <i>Cladrastis</i> and relatives are sister to the 50 KB inversion clade (e.g. Cardoso et al. 2013b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">50 KB inversion clade. Relationships at the base of this clade form an extensive polytomy (9-furcate in Cardoso et al. 2013b). The ectomycorrhizal <i>Aldina</i> is placed in a basal clade with <i>Andira</i> and <i>Hymenolobium</i>, all members of which have a drupaceous fruit, an undifferentiated testa, no endosperm, etc. (Ramos et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">GEN: x = 9. Crisp et al. (2000) outline relationships in Genisteae s.l., with their distinctive quinolizidine (pyrrolizidine) alkaloids (see also van Wyk 2003 for chemistry). <i>Genista</i> is perhaps to include <i>Ulex</i> and other genera, but relationships between the major groups in the genus are poorly supported; <i>Cytisus</i> is paraphyletic (Pardo et al. 2004). For relationships within Crotalarieae, see Boatwright et al. (2008b, esp. c, 2009) and of <i>Lotononis</i> and relatives in particular, Boatwright et al. (2011: also character evolution). Le Roux et al. (2013) found little support for relationships along the backbone of  <i>Crotalaria</i>, although several well-supported clades were recovered. For relationships within Psoraleae, see Egan and Crandall (2008), and in Canary Island Genisteae, see Percy and Cronk (2002), for diversification in Cape genistoids, see Edwards and Hawkins (2007); for relationships in <i>Ononis</i>, see Liston (1995),  and in <i>Cytisus</i>, which includes <i>Ulex</i>, see Cubas et al. (2002) and Cristofilini and Troia (2006). Bacterial infection is through the epidermis, nodule morphology is very various (J. J. Doyle 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">DAL: Nodules small, oblate, determinate, always associated with a lateral root common [desmodioid nodules = aeschynomenoid nodules - Lavin et al. 2001]; (leaves opposite -= <i>Platymiscium</i>); x = 10. For the phylogeny of dalbergioid legumes, see Lavin et al. (2000). <i>Machaerium</i> is more related to <i>Aeschynomene</i> section <i>Ochopodium</i> (that genus is polyphyletic) than to <i>Dalbergia</i>, so the apparent similarities in habit, fruit, etc., between <i>Machaerium</i> and <i>Dalbergia</i> need re-evaluating (Ribeiro et al. 2007; Chaintreuil et al. 2013). Cardoso et al. (2012a, b) and Klitg&aring;rd et al. (2013) noted that taxa with polysymmetric flowers had evolved several times in this clade. For relationships within Amorpheae and the floral evolution of the latter (petals may be lost, or all look rather similar; a stemonozone may be developed; etc.), see McMahon and Hufford (2002, 2004, 2005) and McMahon (2005). The large genus <i>Dalbergia</i> is likely to be monophyletic (Vatanparast et al. 2013). For relationships in <i>Arachis</i>, see Krapovickas and Gregory (2007).  </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">MIRB: For relationships in or revisions of <i>Mirbelia</i> s.l., see Crisp and Cook (2003a, b), <i>Gastrolobium</i>, Chandler et al. (2001), <i>Pultenaea</i>, Orthia et al. (2005b), and <i>Jacksonia</i>, Chappill et al.  (2007). [Mirbelieae + Hypocalypteae] are around 55 m.y.o. (Schrire et al. 2005).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">MILL:  For characters of the millettioid clade, see Tucker (1987a); see da Sila (2012) for a phylogeny of part of this clade, <i>Lonchocarpus</i> is split. [Milletieae + Indigofereae] may share early expression of monosymmetry in floral development (Paulino et al. 2011). For the delimitation of Millettieae, see Lavin et al. (1998); Hu (2000) and Hu et al. (2000) studied their phylogeny, and <i>Abrus</i> (with nine stamens) is (near-)basal (Prenner 2013b and references). Kajita et al. (2001: <i>rbc</i>L) also looked at the phylogeny of Millettieae and relatives, and in an extensive study de Queiroz et al. (2015) found the relationships [Indigofereae [Clitorieae [Phaseoleae, etc. [Abreae [Diocleae + Millettieae]]]]], although the relationships obtained depended on the markers used (Egan et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Indigofereae. These have true racemes (Wojciechowski et al. 2004); <i>Desmodium</i> et al. lack the chloroplast <i>rps</i>12 intron (Jansen et al. 2008). Barker et al. (2000) and Schrire et al. (2009) disentangle relationships within the tribe, finding considerable phylogenetic structure (i.a. there are four major clades within <i>Indigofera</i>) that can be linked with both morphology and ecology. Phaseoleae, etc.. Stefanovic et al. (2009: eight chloroplast genes) concentrated on relationships among the some 2,000 species of phaseoloids, finding substantial resolution, i.a. <i>Mucuna</i> sister to <i>Desmodium</i> and its relatives, the combined clade being sister to the rest of the group, which also includes <i>Cajanus</i>, <i>Vigna</i>, <i>Erythrina</i>, etc. (see also H. Li et al. 2013 for a more detailed analysis of Phaseoleae-Phaseolineae, &frac34; genera included). For a phylogeny of <i>Phaseolus</i> itself, see Delgado-Salinas et al. (1999, 2006). In a number of phaseolids nodules are determinate, infection usually being by root hairs, i.e. the nodules are desmodioid (J. J. Doyle 2011). <i>Vigna</i> has to be dismembered (Delgado-Salinas et al. 2011), as does <i>Pueraria</i> (of kudzu vine fame), members of which are in five widely separate clades (Egan et al. 2016).  For relationships in the pantropical <i>Mucuna</i>, nearly all lianes, see Moura et al. (2015) and for the optimisation of some fruit and seed characters which correlate nicely with the subgenera, see de Moura et al. (2016). The pantropical <i>Erythrina</i> is not monophyletic (de Moura et al. 2011); for the relationships of <i>Psoralea</i>, see Dludlu et al. (2013).  Brongniartieae. Thompson et al. (2001) looked at relationships within this Australian-South American clade; see also Cardoso et al. (2016) and de Queiroz et al. (2017) for characters, relationships and circumscription. Diocleae. De Queiroz et al. (2015) looked in some detail at relationships in Diocleae, which includes a number of New World lianes, and found genera like <i>Camptosema</i> and <i>Galactia</i> were very much polyphyletic; for relationships in <i>Canavalia</i>, see Snak et al. (2016: stem, ca 15.8 m.y.o., crown, (11.1-)8.7(-6.7) m.y.). Millettieae. For the phylogeny of <i>Derris</i> and its immediate relatives, see Sirichamorn et al. (2012, 2014a, b).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">ROB: For the phylogeny of <i>Robinia</i> and its relatives, which include <i>Lotus</i> and <i>Sesbania</i>, two genera that are quite close, see Wojciechowski et al. (2000), Lavin et al. (2003: <i>Gliricidia</i> area), and Farruggia and Wojciechowski (2009: <i>Sesbania</i>), and of Canary Island Loteae, see Allan et al. (2004). Degtareva et al. (2012) looked at relationships of <i>Anthyllis</i>, and Allan et al. (2003) at those around <i>Lotus</i>, with <b>Hammatolobium</b> being sister to Old World <i>Lotus</i>, and the unrelated New World <i>Lotus</i> perhaps including <i>Ornithopus</i> and other genera in a basal polytomy (see also Degtjareva et al. 2008; Kramina et al. 2016).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">IRLC clade. Wojciechowski et al. (2000) outlined relationships in this speciose clade. At the base of the clade relationships are [<i>Glycyrrhiza</i> [<i>Wisteria</i> s.l. + ...]], <i>Wisteria</i> being embedded in <i>Callerya</i>, although <i>C. atropurpurea</i> was tending to wander between <i>Wisteria</i> s.l. and <i>Glycyrrhiza</i> (J. Li et al. 2014). Extensive phylogenetic studies (e.g. Wojciechowski 1993, 2004; Wojciechowski et al. 1999; Kasempour Osaloo et al. 2004; Scherson et al. 2004) show that <i>Astragalus</i> is monophyletic; most New World taxa are aneuploid  (n = 11-15) and are also monophyletic, other species are base 8; for relationships in Old World <i>Astragalus</i>, see Kasempour Osaloo et al. (2004), Kazemi et al. (2009) and Riahi et al. (2011). <i>Oxytropis</i> is sister to <i>Astragalus</i>; for some relationships in the former, see Archambault and Str&ouml;mvik (2012). Hedysareae and Galegeae are intermixed (Duan et al. 2015), and might best be combined; <i>Hedysarum</i> itself is polyphyletic. Within the combined clade, Safaei Chaei Kar et al. (2014) looked at relationships within <i>Onobrychis</i> and found that current infrageneric groupings had little support, Amirahmadi et al. (2016) providing an elaborated phylogeny, while for the phylogeny and diversification of <i>Caragana</i> in the context of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau uplift, see M. Zhang et al. (2009, 2015), Zhang and Fritsch (2010) and Duan et al. (2016). For the limits of Trifolieae, see Dangi et al. (2015). Within <i>Trifolium</i> the American species form a monophyletic group (Ellison et al. 2006; Liston et al. 2006). Phylogenetic relationships within <i>Medicago</i> have turned out to be highly reticulating (de Sousa et al. 2016 and references); <i>Medicago</i>  perhaps including <i>Trigonella</i>, and for its limits, see Bena (2001), Steele et al. (2010) and Dangi et al. (2015: <i>Medicago</i> and <i>Trigonella</i> separate?). A preliminary phylogeny of <i>Lathyrus</i> suggested that the ca 20 South American species might represent a single clade derived from Northern hemisphere ancestors (Asmussen &amp; Liston 1998; see also Kenicer et al. 2005). Relationships in the <i>Vicia</i>/<i>Lathyrus</i> area are complex, with <i>Lenus</i> and <i>Pisum</i> embdedded in the complex, <i>Trigonella</i> perhaps including <i>Melilotus</i> and Vicieae embedded in Trifolieae (e.g. Steele &amp; Wojciechowski 2003; Schaefer et al. 2012). Within Hedysareae <i>Alhagi</i> may be sister to the rest (Amirahmadi et al. 2014). Fabeae are the subject of an extensive study by Schaefer et al. (2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b>  In the past, Fabaceae have usually been divided into three groups, Fabaceae/oideae (= Leguminosae/-oideae), Mimosaceae/-oideae and Caesalpiniaceae/-ioideae, but the latter have turned out to be paraphyletic. See the Legume Phylogeny Working Group (2013b) for a fascinating introduction to the dynamics of the reclassification of the family; relationships at the deeper nodes are poorly known, but the old Mimosoideae are deeply embedded in Caesalpinioideae, so changes in the names for the major elements that make up the scaffolding of the family were to be expected. These have recently been published (Legume Phylogeny Working Group 2017), and i.a. the old Mimosoideae are now to be refered to as "the mimosoid clade", a not unreasonable decision pending clarification of relationships around the old Mimosoideae. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">See Lewis et al. (2013) for a linear sequence of legume genera recognised as of March, 2013. Cardoso et al. (2013b) list the early-branching clades of Faboideae, i.e., those below the NPAAA clade, as well as the genera and numbers of species that they contain.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In general, a fair bit of adjustment to generic limits is also needed,  but in some cases, although it is clear that there will be changes, sampling is not good enough to know yet what to do (e.g. see Percy &amp; Cronk 2002; Allan et al. 2004; Ribeiro et al. 2007; Cardoso et al. 2012a; Dludlu et al. 2013). For generic limits in Cercidoideae, see Wunderlin (2010; Sinou et al. 2009 for the phylogeny), for those in the <i>Caesalpinia</i> group, initially unclear (Gagnon et al. 2013), see Gagnon et al. (2017), for those around <i>Gastrolobium</i>, see Chandler et al. (2001), for those around <i>Vigna</i>, see Delgado-Salinas et al. (2011), for those around <i>Lotononis</i>, see Boatwright et al. (2011), for those around <i>Calliandra</i>, see de Souza et al. (2013), and for those around <i>Mimosa</i>, see Seigler et al. (2017); the limits of <i>Derris</i> have been redrawn (Sirichamorn et al. 2014b). Unique combinations of floral characters can be used to recognize genera around <i>Crotalaria</i> (Le Roux &amp; van Wyk 2012); see Orthia et al. (2005a, b) for the expanded generic limits of <i>Pultenaea</i>. Schaefer et al. (2012) suggest that one solution to the unexpected phylogenetic relationships they found in Fabeae might be to include <i>Lens</i> in <i>Vicia</i> and <i>Pisum</i> in <i>Lathyrus</i>...</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The old <i>Acacia</i> subgenus <i>Acacia</i>, which includes the
bull's horn acacias, seems to be monophyletic, but <i>Acacia</i> s.l. is polyphyletic. As Maslin (2001) noted sadly of the 955 or so species then placed in <i>Acacia</i> for the <i>Flora of Australia</i> treatment, "we are obliged to present the flora treatment in the absence of a more meaningful classification". However, things had already begun to change, although Pedley's (1986) solution following strict nomenclatural lines was proving only partly acceptab;e, and the argument became what names to use for the bits into which <i>Acacia</i> s.l. was clearly to be divided (Maslin et al. 2003). See Miller and Bayer (2003; also Boatwright et al. 2015) for <i>Vachellia</i>, the old subgenus <i>Acacia</i>, and <i>Senegalia</i>, the old subgenus <i>Aculeiferum</i>; see also Siegler et al. (2006) for the American segregate <i>Mariosousa</i>. However, some remain deeply unsatisified with this nomenclatural solution.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">See Pennington (1997) for a monograph of <i>Inga</i> and Dexter et al. (2010) for some species limits there. In Faboideae, for a sectional classification of the neotropical <i>Swartzia</i>, see Torke and Mansano (2009), for that of an expanded <i>Cytisus</i>, see Cristofilini and Troia (2006), for that of the pantropical <i>Crotalaria</i>, see le Roux et al. (2013), and for that of <i>Obobrychis</i>, see Amirahmadi et al. (2016). Thompson (2001) provides a careful study of E. Australian <i>Hovea</i> (Brongniartieae).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Fabaceae s.l. have often been placed in
their own order, as in both Cronquist (1981) and Takhtajan (1997), and then they are usually divided into three families, Fabaceae/Leguminosae, Caesalpiniaceae and Mimosaceae. They can be confused with Connaraceae
(Oxalidales), although the latter lack stipules, their flowers are polysymmetric and have stamens of two distinctly different lengths, and their
gynoecium is frequently multicarpellate. However, in both the RP122 chloroplast gene has moved to the
nucleus, and the ovaries of both have adaxial furrows (c.f. the ventral slit: Matthews &amp; Endress 2002). Fabaceae have also been linked
with Sapindaceae (e.g. Dickison 1981b), here in the malvids, but there is little support other than the common possession of compound leaves and non-protein amino acids for such an association.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Botanical Trivia.</b> There has been as much diversification of the  <i>ycf</i>4 protein, involved in photosystem 1 assembly, within <i>Lathyrus</i> as there has been between cyanobacteria and other angiosperms (Magee et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The seeds of <i>Mora megistosperma</i> (Caesalpinieae) are, at ca 18 x 12 cm, perhaps the largest of any broad-leaved angiosperm (Lewis et al. 2005), and the embryo is the largest of all angiosperms.</p>

<p>Synonymy: <b>Diclidantheraceae</b> J. Agardh, <b>Moutabeaceae</b>
Pfeiffer</p>

<ul><li>Polygalaceae are woody or herbaceous plants that may be recognised by their often
yellowish-drying simple and entire leaves; there are quite frequently paired
glands at the nodes or glands or domatia on the leaf blades and Polygaleae often smell of wintergreen. The flowers are
usually monosymmetric and more or less papilionaceous. They range from having five rather large sepals and five petals - not strongly papilionaceous - to having two of the sepals much enlarged and coloured (the "wings" of the flower), two of the petals much reduced, and the three remaining petals modified as "standard" and "keel" - strongly papilionaceous. There are two or more carpels and a single style.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The evolution of elaiosomes in Polygalaceae is dated to (69.9-)54-50.5(-35.2) m.y.a., well after that of the ant clades concerned (by some estimates, at least), and it may have spurred diversification in the family (Forest et al. 2007b; Lengyel et al. 2009).  <i>Muraltia</i>, also myrmecochorous and with some 120 species found mostly in the Cape region of South Africa, may have diversified quite recently, mostly within the last ca 10 m.y. (Forest et al. 2007a); Verboom et al. (2009) thought diversification started in the Fynbos (21.4-)18.5(-14.1) m.y.a. and in the Succulent Karoo (4-)2.5(-1.3) m.y.a.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bello et al. (2012) list a number of apomorphies for the family and of several clades within it.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Xanthophyllum</i> is one of the five most speciose genera in West Malesian l.t.r.f. (Davies et al. 2005).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> The flower in Polygalaceae is quite
differently constructed from that of Fabaceae (Westerkamp &amp; Weber 1999; Bello et al. 2010, but see Prenner 2004d), although quite often both looking and being
functionally similar. Note that the flowers of <i>Polygala</i>, which in overall appearance are particularly like those of some Fabaceae, do not represent the plesiomorphic condition of Polygalaceae; overall floral variation in Polygalaceae is considerable.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In at least some North American species of <i>Polygala</i> pollen is presented on the sterile lobes of the asymmetric stigma (secondary pollen presentation: Weekley &amp; Brothers 1996; see Castro et al. 2008a for details; Bello et al. 2010 for details of stigma morphology).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Ant dispersal is quite common in Polygaleae, and hilar/chalazal elaiosomes (the former are called caruncles) may be an apomorphy here, and there may have been at least six origins of myrmechochory in the family (Forest et al. 2007b; Lengyel et al. 2009, 2010 for myrmecochory). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> <i>Epirixanthes</i> is an echlorophyllous mycoheterotroph associated with glomeromycota (for details of the fungal association, see Imhof 2007; Imhof et al. 2013). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> Although genera like <i>Xanthophyllum</i> and some Moutabeae may have paired glands at the nodes, other genera seem to lack anything even faintly like stipules, and where stipules might be lost in this part of the tree is uncertain. De Aguiar-Dias et al. (2011) have recently suggested that the paired nectary glands at the base of the leaf in <i>Polygala laureola</i> are indeed stipules because they  receive a vascular bundle from the single foliar vascular trace.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> There is a genome duplication somewhere around here (Cannon et al. 2014).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Polygala myrtifolia</i> has eight stamens; the two stamens in the median plane, so on opposite sides of the flower, appear to have been lost (Prenner 2004d); see Bello et al. (2010) for other floral diagrams. The degree of connation of the filaments varies, as does that of their sometimes rather slight adnation to the petals. For floral morphology and development of Polygaleae, see Kr&uuml;ger and Robbertse (1988) and Kr&uuml;ger et al. (1988), and for that of the family as a whole, see Bello et al. (2010, 2012). The tricolpate pollen of <i>Balgooya</i> is probably derived; some Polygalaceae such as <i>Heterosamara</i> have asymmetric, almost boat-shaped pollen grains (Banks et al. 2008). Some species of <i>Polygala</i>, at least, have a stylar canal (Castro et al. 2008b). <i>Monnina</i> seems to have a nucellar cap ca 6 cells across, while the inner integument of <i>Securidaca</i> is up to 9 cells across in the endostomal region (Verkeke 1985). In indehiscent fruits the testa is more or less crushed (Rodrigue 1893; but c.f. Verkeke 1984, 1985). Verkeke (1985) distinguished between epitropous-dorsal ovules (<i>Xanthophyllum</i>) and epitropous-ventral ovules (the rest).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Additional information is taken
from Eriksen (1993a) and especially from Eriksen and Persson (2006), both general; Chodat (1891, 1893) is still worth consulting. For chemistry, see Hegnauer (1969, 1990),  for wood and leaf anatomy of Moutabeae, see Styer (1977), also  Banks et al. (2008: pollen morphology and evolution), Manning and Stirton (1994: endothecial thickenings), and Verkeke and Bouman (1980), Verkeke (1991) and Takhtajan (2000), all ovule and seed. Also see Johow (1910) and Merckx et al. (2013a), both <i>Epirixanthes</i>, Paiva (1998: <i>Polygala</i>, especially Africa and Madagascar), and for a monograph of <i>Xanthophyllum</i>, van der Meijden (1982).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Of the four groups mentioned above, Moutabeae may be paraphyletic (Persson 2001: <i>trn</i>L-F), although adding <i>rbc</i>L data suggests they are monophyletic (Forest, in  Eriksen &amp; Persson 2006), and morphology points in this direction (Eriksen 1993b); the other three groups appear to be monophyletic (although Carpolobieae are only weakly supported). However, all four tribes are strongly supported in a three-gene analysis (Forest et al. 2007b), and Xanthophylleae are sister to the other three tribes; relationships between the three were unclear and remain so in Bello et al. (2012). <i>Polygala</i> and <i>Bredemeyera</i> are grossly paraphyletic (Persson 2001; Abbott 2011). See Eriksen (1993b) for a morphological phylogeny.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Because of the polyphyly of <i>Polygala</i> and <i>Bredemeyera</i> generic adjustments are needed (see Pastore 2012; Abbott et al. 2011, 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> The Polygalales of Cronquist (1981) included seven families, the mutual affinities of five of which were described as being "widely acce pted". These include Xanthophyllaceae (= Polygalaceae), Vochysiaceae (Myrtales), Trigoniaceae (Malpighiales) and Tremandraceae (= Elaeocarpaceae,  Oxalidales). For Emblingiaceae, often included in (e.g. Cronquist 1981;
Mabberley 1997) or near (e.g. Takhtajan 1997) Polygalaceae, see Brassicales. </p>
