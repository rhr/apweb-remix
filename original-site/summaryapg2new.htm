<p><b><a name="apwebhierarchy">SUMMARY OF APOMORPHIES IN /APweb/</a></b><br>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Note that there may be more detail in the characterisations, even those of the orders, on the individual order pages than appears below as possible apomorphies. This is because the ordinal pages are much more works in progress when it comes to character abstractions. These pages should always be consulted for other characters that may be apomorphies at various levels.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">When scanning the summary of potential apomorphies below, remember the sometimes extreme problems one currently faces when trying to place characters on the tree. I repeat some of the points I made in the Introduction:</p>

<p>1.  I may not have found all the information about a particular character, there may be disagreement over its interpretation (e.g. Austrobaileyales), or I have added unpublished information (e.g. Myrsinaceae and their relatives, nodal anatomy, etc.; Diapensiaceae, leaf ptyxis; Peridiscaceae, Centroplacaceae, etc.).</p>

<p>2. The sampling of nearly all molecular studies is incomplete (see Salisbury &amp; Kim 2001 for problems caused by sampling).  But not only is the sampling in molecular studies often less than we might wish, that of the morphological and chemical characters whose evolution we are interested in understanding is often also very poor. </p>

<p>3. I am fitting characters to a very conservative tree with many polychotomies, although the nodes that are utilised are for the most part strongly supported. This makes optimisation of characters, the assigment of character state change to a particular node on the tree, notably difficult (e.g. Madison &amp; Madison 2002). In nearly all studies of the evolution of characters, the distributions of those characters are optimised on a more or less fully resolved tree, and the construction of supertrees may yield much more detailed hypotheses of relationships.  Of course, some nodes on such fully resolved trees and/or supertrees may have little support, and optimisations based on such trees may carry correspondingly little conviction...  To see the kind of thing that may happen as our knowledge of relationships improves, note the difference below between the possible synapomorphies given on the Dipsacales page for Dipsacales, and those that might remain if [Columelliaceae + Desfontaineaceae] were sister to Dipsacales. Even in some trees included here, parts have poor support, e.g. Ceratophyllaceae as sister to monocots, relationships within aquatic Alismatales, etc.</p> 

<p>4. Exactly how one goes about optimising a character on a tree is critically important. Thus using either parsimony or maximum likelihood, making apparently reasonable suggestions about weighting gains over losses (or vice versa), or more complex assumptions along similar lines, or simply using ACCTRAN or DELTRAN to place the character on the tree (e.g. Donoghue &amp; Ackerley 1996; Cunningham et al. 1998; Omland 1997, 1999; Ree &amp; Donoghue 1999; Polly 2001; Webster &amp; Purvis 2001; Ronquist 2004; Crisp &amp; Cook 2005), may greatly affect the position of
synapomorphies on trees, and hence our ideas of evolution. I have tried to indicate where there are particularly important uncertainties as to where characters should be placed on the tree. </p>




<p>5. Finally, although I have paid quite a lot of
attention to the delimitation of the character
"states" that make up all characterizations, I have not spent enough time on this critical operation. If we are interested in understanding evolution, then fitting the basic variation - not character states - to a tree in
principle allows greater flexibility in understanding morphology in the context of local phylogenies (see also Stevens 2000; Endress 2005c). However,
many states used here still owe their circumscriptions if not to their delimitation in the context of global phylogenetic
analyses, at least to thinking about the variation shown by a particular
character across all angiosperms. Such states often have arbitrary limits, and serve best to communicate "information"; whether they are in fact suitable for either phylogenetic analysis or understanding evolution are separate issues. So when interpreting the literature in which character states are optimised on a tree, one should bear in mind the problems surrounding the delimitation of states (e.g. Stevens 2000, 2006b). Furthermore, studies have rather unsurprisingly, perhaps, but importantly shown that dividing the one character into different sets of states may yield differing ideas of evolution of that character (e.g. Lamb Frye & Kron 2003; Hibbett 2004).</p>


<p>As one might expect, with increasing knowledge of development, etc., delimitation of states and characters does not necessarily become easier. Thus Buzgo et al. (2004) and Matthews and Endress (2005) show how hard it can be to delimit states or even to distinguish between e.g. prophylls and other floral structures, Peney et al. (2005) found that not all monosulcate pollen grains in monocots have the same developmental pathway, and therefore such pollen might not have the same ancestral state, while Reeves and Olmstead (2003) suggested that the genetic mechanisms causing monosymmetry in Lamiales and Solanales were different and Serna and Martin (2006) described similar problems with the development of hairs in <u>Arabidopsis</u> and <u>Antirrhinum</u> and Solanaceae.</p>

<p>Endress and Matthews (2006a) emphasize the importance of tendencies and developmental constraints when thinking about characters of clades within the rosids - many characters, or character combinations, in these clades occur in a rather sporadic fashion within the clade and apparently notably less frequently outside it. There are a number of other examples in the order pages here, ranging from the features enclosed by parentheses in groups above the level of family, e.g. "(cuticular waxes as aggregated rodlets)" for the commelinids to the discussion of ovular features in the asterids (see Cornales page), although I have kept few of these features in this page. One of the most striking examples is the distribution of N-fixation, restricted as it is to a monophyletic group of four clades, although it has arisen seven or more times independently within that clade (e.g. Clawson et al. 2004). More concrete examples of work that bears on the issue of tendencies include the findings that flowers of polysymmetrical <u>Arabidopsis</u> have genes like TCP1 that are expressed asymmetrically during early development, and TCP1 is a probable orthologue of the well-known CYC gene of <u>Antirrhinum</u> (Cubas et al. 2001; Costa et al. 2005; etc.). Parallelism might build on this underlying morphologically cryptic monosymmetry, even if details of the genetic mechanisms causing the monosymmetry evident in particular groups may be different (Reeves &amp; Olmstead 2003; Cubas 2004 see above). It has also been suggested that for some secondary metabolites in particular there is aquisition of the capability to synthesise a particular metabolite; this is then switched off, but not lost - and is sometimes reacquired again (e.g. Wink 2003; Liscombe et al. 2005). Hence the rather spotty distribution of some of these metabolites when considered in the context of phylogenies. As a non-botanical example - but a rather nice one - Salwini-Plawen and Mayr (1961) suggested some time ago that there has been considerable parallelism (40-65 or more independent origins) in the evolution of eyes in metazoans. However, <i>Pax 6</i> seems to be a master control gene that is involved in eye formation perhaps throughout all bilateralians (e.g. Gehring &amp; Ikeo 1999; Erwin &amp; Davidson 2002). When thinking of the association of camplylotopy and micropyle type, or integument thickness and vascularization of the integument (Endress &amp; Matthews 2006a), one can imagine fairly simple developmental preconditions being operative: as Endress and Matthews (2006a) note, it is difficult to imagine vascular tissue developing in an integument only two cells thick. Changes here would be loosely correlated, if morphologically linked. However, the strongly correlated changes noted by Givnish et al. (2005) are ecologically linked but are presumably morphologically/developmentally independent. When there seem to be characters evolving more or less together, one needs to test to see if the changes are concentrated on certain branches of the tree (Maddison 1990; Maddison &amp; Maddison 2000).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">I use Remane's three main criteria of "homology", special properties, position, and intermediates, when determining the basic similarity of structures on different organisms. Even these criteria may not yield an unambiguous answer as to what a structure "is", even given a solid phylogeny. As Endress (2005c) observed, a number of features - position, function, development, shape, anatomy, histology, gene activity, and relationships to other taxa that clearly have petals - can be used to distinguish a petal (for example) from other floral structures, so if a petal does not have one of these features, is it thereby not a petal? There is rampant parallelism in seed plants, yet, as mentioned elsewhere, the terms we use to describe seed plants do not replect this; to reform terms so that they relected phylogeny/synapomorphies  would cause an immense amount of grief! Given our current understandings of both phylogenies and characters, evolution of some characters in which we are interested seems to be very labile indeed (e.g. see Soltis et al. 2005b), and I have tried to be very cautious when talking about character evolution.  </p>




<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Finally, far too many features are still described as encompassing alternatives or a range of variation. This is perhaps an unlikely situation for apomorphies for major clades, although less so for - say - ecological preferences at the species level (Hardy 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">As an example of the cumulative effect of some of these problems, below I suggest two sets of possible apomorphies for Dipsacales, the first (A) is that if [Columelliaceae + Desfontaineaceae] is their sister group and includes a characterisation of that larger group, the second (B) is the one given in the Dipsacales page, which simply represents the characters common to Dipsacales and is largely innocent of any considerations of their possible outgroups.</p>

<p><b>A. [Columelliaceae + Desfontaineaceae] + Dipsacales</b>: Group I secoiridoids +; cork deep-seated; nodes ?; pericyclic fibers 0; petiole
bundles arcuate; leaves opposite, bases &plusmn; confluent, margins
gland-toothed; inflorescence terminal, cymose; flowers moderate in size, G inferior, (many ovules/carpel), style long; K persistent in fruit; exotestal cells enlarged, variously thickened and lignified.</p>

<p><b>Dipsacales</b>: True tracheids +; nodes 3:3; buds with scales; nectaries as multicellular
hairs on corolla, pollen grains trinucleate; testa
vascularised, (exotestal cells palisade).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">But of course even these characterisations may be strongly affected by the features of the clade sister to any [[Columelliaceae + Desfontaineaceae] Dipsacales] grouping... </p>

<p><b>B. Dipsacales</b>: Group I secoiridoids +; true tracheids +; nodes 3:3; petiole
bundles arcuate; buds with scales; leaves opposite, bases &plusmn; confluent, margins
gland-toothed; inflorescence terminal, cymose; nectaries as multicellular
hairs on corolla, pollen grains trinucleate; K persistent in fruit; testa
vascularised, exotestal cells enlarged (palisade), variously thickened and lignified.</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Also included in the synapomorphy hierarchy are brief indications of the sizes and distributions of families and subfamilies, and usually also features by which families can be recognised. If you click on a family name that is highlighted, you will be taken to that family on the relevant ordinal page.
