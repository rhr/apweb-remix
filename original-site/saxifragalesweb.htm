<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Both sepals and petals of core eudicots may be derived from bracts, bracts and sepals often having three or more traces, petals a single trace  (Ronse de Craene (2007); only cases where the vasculature is other than this are mentioned below. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Moore et al. (2010) suggest an age of (112-)108(103) m.y. for this node (if it exists).</p>


<p><a name="Saxvitros">[SAXIFRAGALES [VITALES + ROSIDS]]</a> / ROSANAE</b> Takhtajan / <b>SUPERROSIDAE</b>: ?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="treeapweb2map.html" target="home">Back to Main Tree</a></p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The age of this node has been estimated at (125-)121, 111(-107) m.y. (Wikstr&amp;m et al. 2004; similar in Jian et al. 2008); the age in Anderson et al. (2005: see positions of Crossosomatales included) is ca 108 m.y., it is ca 160 m.y. in Z. Wu et al. (2014: [Vit. + Sax.] sister to rest, ca 151 m.y.a. divergence between the two), while the comparable figures in Foster et al. (2016a: q.v. for details) are  128 and 125 m.y. respectively. Magall&oacute;n and Castillo (2009) provide estimates of around 114.5 m.y., Moore et al. (2010: 95% highest posterior density) an age of  (111-)108(-103) m.y.; ages of (135-)128, 117(-111) m.y. are suggested by Bell et al. (2010), (112-)107(-101) m.y. by N. Zhang et al. (2012), 110.5 m.y. by Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013), 114-111 m.y. by M. Sun et al. (2014) and  ca 117.7 m.y. by Tank et al. (2015: Table S1) - or ca 58 m.y. (Palazzesi et al. 2012, but c.f. Sytsma et al. 2014 - ca 104 m.y.).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fossils are somewhat younger, and those assignable to rosids as a whole are ca 94 m.y.o., and those to Saxifragales ca 90 m.y. old (Crepet et al. 2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Much crown group diversification within this clade probably occurred within a narrow time interval of 5-15 m.y. around 117-93 m.y.a. in the late Aptian early Turonian (Wang et al. 2009; see also Jian et al. 2008).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Increase in seed size is especially distinctive at this node, and this is associated with large leaf size; plants commonly grow in equatorial areas that are both warm and well-watered (Cornwell et al. 2014: c.f. Saxifragales). A relatively large embryo over half the length of the seed may be a feature of this clade (Forbis et al. 2002), although there is considerable variation in Saxifragales and Vitales have small embryos. Here this character has been pegged at a higher level in the phylogeny (see core rosids).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Smets et al. (2003) characterise the rosids as having receptacular nectaries; but Vitales have gynoecial nectaries and basal to this clade Proteaceae, and perhaps Sabiaceae, also have receptacular nectaries (Smets 1988). For <i>CRABSCLAW</i> expression in the floral nectaries, see Damerval et al. (2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Maherali et al. (2016) note that ectomycorrhizal associations in angiosperms are commonest in this clade.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Butterfly caterpillars are common on members of the group, occurring about twice as frequently as might be expected going by species number alone, but the tree habit is also common here, and trees perhaps can support a correspondingly disproportionately large number of larvae (Janz &amp; Nylin 1998). However, Menken et al. (2009; see also Ward et al. 2003) reported on an extensive survey of larval host plants of British lepidoptera which they thought could be extended - with care - more globally, noting that caterpillars of basal Lepidoptera-Glossata (butterflies and moths with a coilable proboscis) tended to be found on woody rosid I (Fabidae) plants, normally as leaf miners or other non-exposed life styles (see also Ward et al. 2003). Since mines attributed to basal glossatan Neptulicidae have been reported from fossil magnoliid and protealean leaves, among others (see Menken et al. 2009), and these plants have a rather different chemistry from that of the rosids, the deep history of such lepidoptera-plant associations is unclear.</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> For a possible genome duplication, see Tuskan et al. (2006) and Jaillon, Eury et al. (2007); it is probably to be placed immediately basal to the <a href="gunneralesweb.htm#Guncor" target="home">core eudicot</a> node. Where the loss of the chloroplast <i>inf</i>A gene is to be placed is unclear (see Millen et al. 2001). 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Taxa that have cuticle wax platelets as rosettes are scattered through this group, but they are especially common in Fabaceae and there are also several Malpighiales (see Ditsch &amp; Barthlott 1997 for details). Distinctive mucilage cells with a much thickened mucilaginous inner periclinal wall and distinct cytoplasm are found in flowers especially in this broader group, but they are not yet reported from Geraniales (Matthews &amp; Endress 2006b). The sepals characteristically have three traces from three gaps; in several more basal eudicot clades the outer perianth/sepals have only a single gap (von Balthazar and Endress 2002 - see also Ranunculales). Petal development is often retarded relative to that of other parts of the flower (also in <i>Cabomba</i> and <i>Saruma</i>). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Basal relationships within rosids remain somewhat unclear, particularly the positions of Vitales and Saxifragales (N. Zhang et al. 2016: Fig. 1 for four common hypotheses, fabids include the COM clade). Hilu et al. (2003: <i>mat</i>K analysis, <i>Schumacheria</i> [the one Dilleniaceae included] was firmly associated with Ericales...) found a possible set of relationships [Rosids [[Dilleniacaeae + Vitaceae] [Saxifragales [Santalales [Berberidopsidales [Caryophyllales + Asterids]]]]]]. Nickrent et al. (2005) found the position of Saxifragales to be particularly uncertain, although Vitales again tended to go with rosids. Soltis et al. (2007a) found a grouping [Saxifragales [Vitales + rosids]], both groupings with 1.0 p.p. (see also Zhu et al 2007, but little support). Earlier work had suggested similar relationships, thus Saxifragales were sister to the rest of the group (e.g. P. Soltis et al. 1999: Vitales not included), albeit with little support. 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Moore et al. (2010, 2011) found that although [Saxifragales, Vitales, rosids] formed a strongly-supported clade, it was unclear whether Vitales were sister to Saxifragales, to rosids, or to [Saxifragales + rosids]; support for the latter position increased with reduced taxon sampling. Moore et al. (2010) also recovered a [Saxifragales + Vitales] clade sister to rosids in maximum likelihood but not in maximum parsimony analyses, and this also appeared in most analyses in Ruhfel et al. (2014), in both nuclear and chloroplast, but not in mitochondrial, analyses in M. Sun et al. (2014: divergence  114-110 m.y.a., 2015), and in the chloroplast genome analyses of Z. Wu et al. (2014) and N. Zhang et al. (2016: good support). Zhang et al. (2016; see also Soltis et al. 2013) suggested that a bicarpellate gynpoecium might be a synapomorphy for the clade, but support for this must at best be weak.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Hengcheng Wang et al. (2009: Dilleniales not included) in a 43,000 bp analysis, largely of chloroplast sequences, found substantial resolution within rosids s.l., and the relationships that they suggest, [Saxifragales [Vitales [rosid I/fabids + rosid II/malvids]]], are followed here (but maybe not for much longer), although the position of Vitales is only moderately supported (72% bootstrap in a ML analysis); they analysed a twelve-gene and inverted repeat data sets separately and in  combination, preferring ML over MP analyses. The topology in Davies et al. (2004), Bell et al. (2010) and Soltis et al. (2011) is similar. Saxifragales are also well supported as sister to [Vitales + rosids] in the 12-gene plus plastid inverted repeat analyses of Wang et al. (2009).  Vitales may well be sister to the  other rosids s. str. (e.g. Jansen et al. 2007), although support was only weak in Wang et al. (2009). A palaeohexaploidy event seemed to link Vitales with rosids, but the sampling in major core eudicot clades was very poor (Jaillon, Eury et al. 2007), and that event may be a synapomorphy for core eudicots (see <a href="gunneralesweb.htm#Guncor" target="home">above</a>).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Studies on the duplication of the <i>RPB</i>2 gene and subsequent loss of one of the copies (Oxelman et al. 2004; Luo et al. 2007) suggest that Saxifragales and Rosids are linked by loss of the -I copy, which also has occurred in Santalales and Caryophyllales, but not Vitales, Berberidopsidales, Gunnerales or Dilleniales, which have all lost the <i>RPB</i>2-D copy. Saxifragales and Vitales were found to be successively sister to all eudicots minus Gunnerales (mitochondrial gene only), or to all rosids, but with little support (Zhu et al. 2007). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Finally, Saxifragales have sometimes been found to be sister to a [Berberidopsidales ... asterid] clade, although with vanishingly low support, and Vitales sister to a rosid clade, but with scarcely any stronger support  (Qiu et al. 2010). What are essentially the reverse positions of these two problematic orders were recovered by Soltis et al. (2015, in N. Zhang et al. 2016). Crossosomatales were in a clade basal to Caryophyllales, while other relationships in  the rosid II clade were somewhat scrambled, although again with little support (Qiu et al. 2010). The relationships [[Vitaceae + Saxifragales] [Caryophyllales + rosids]] have also popped up (N. Zhang et al. 2012; M. Sun et al. 2104: mitochondrial and nuclear data) as have the  relationships [Vitales [rosids + asterids]] (Wickett et al. 2014: transcriptome analyses), but this latter may be a sampling problem, since no Saxifragales, Dilleniales, etc., were included.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Geranium</i>, the only representative of Geraniales included, was sister to all other rosids except Vitaceae in a study by Zhu et al. (2007, support weak); their position is also unstable in a  <i>rbc</i>L analysis of all angiosperms (Hilu et al. 2003). In some earlier trees, <i>Crossosoma</i> (Crossosomatales) was also included or was nearby, see e.g. Morgan and Soltis (1993), Chase et al. (1993), while in Price and Palmer (1993: <i>rbc</i>L analysis) <i>Biebersteinia</i> (see Sapindales here) was still tentatively included in Geraniales. Savolainen et al. (2000a) found Geraniales to be monophyletic, but with only 52% support (see also Savolainen et al. 2000b); Crossosomatales were still its sister group, but with still less support. However, Soltis et al. (2011, see also Moore et al. 2011) find strong support for relationships in the clade as shown in the Summary Tree, those for [Malvales + Brassicales] at 85% ML bootstrap and for [Geraniales + Myrtales] at 79% being the weakest; all other relationships along the spine have <font face="Symbol">&#179;</font>99% ML bootstrap (see also Ruhfel et al. 2014; M. Sun et al. et al. 2016: support for  the two basal internodes weak). Relationships [Geraniales [Myrtales [Sapindales etc.]]] were recovered by Hohmann et al. (2015) and Foster et al. (2016a: support weak).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Using mitochondrial and chloroplast genes, Zhu et al. (2007) found that Myrtales and Geraniales were successively sister to all other rosids - but with little support (Zhu et al. 2007). S.-B. Lee et al. (2006) found some support for the clade [Geraniales + Myrtales] sister to the rosid I clade, although sampling was poor. Jansen et al. (2007; see also Z. Wu et al. 2014) recovered this [Myrtales + Geraniales] clade as sister to the malvids, albeit with weak support. Xi et al. (2014) found that <i>Eucalyptus</i> was weakly supported as sister to all rosids in  analyses using nuclear data, while in those using chloroplast data, the genus was sister to the malvids, and with strong support, however, representatives of Geraniales were not included and sampling in general was a bit sketchy (this was not the main focus of their work). There is a fair amount of variation in relationships in this area in the trees provided by M. Sun et al. (2014).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fernando et al. (1995) placed Picramniaceae, ex Simaroubaceae, between
the [Fabid + COM] clade, which includes Surianaceae (fabid) and Irvingiaceae (COM clade), both ex Simaroubaceae, and malvids, which
include Simaroubaceae themselves,  but a position along the spine of the malvid clade is best. <i>Picramnia</i> was placed in the position followed by the A.P.G. group (2009, 2016)by e.g. Moore et al. (2011). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Note:</b>  <b>Boldface</b> denotes possible apomorphies, (....) denotes a feature common in the clade, exact status uncertain, [....] includes explanatory material. Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  For additional dates in the order, see Jian et al. (2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Saxifragales contain ca 1.3% of eudicot diversity. They have a very poor representation in the tropics, which makes the inclusion of the small but lowland tropical Peridiscaceae as sister to the rest (see below) the more notable. D. Soltis et al. (2013) looked at diversification in Saxifragales in the context of a 900+-species supermatrix, focusing particularly on woody<->herbaceous and annual<->perennial transitions, while Rubio de Casas et al. (2016) looked at the relationship between habitat and diversification, finding the ancestral habitat to be forest and shifts to the tundra habitat in particular, but also to cliffs and shrublands, to be accompanied by high net diversification rates.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Because many relationships within Saxifragales were difficult to resolve, it was suggested that they represented an ancient and rapid radiation (Fishbein et al. 2001; Fishbein &amp; Soltis 2004). More recently Jian et al. (2006, esp. 2008) estimated that early diversification in the clade perhaps occurred over a period as short as 3-6 m.y., while Hermsen et al. (2006b: topology quite resolved, different in detail from that adopted here, support slight) thought that much diversification occurred around 90-84 m.y.a. in the Late Cretaceous. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Saxifragales have notably small seeds compared with those of other angiosperms (Linkies et al. 2010), although this is not so for Peridiscaceae, not included in that study, so this character is pegged at the next node up here.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">D. Soltis et al. (2007b), Endress (2010c) and Carlsward et al. (2011) have all suggested possible apomorphies  for the clade - or at least features common in the clade - other than those given above, while Hermsen et al. (2006b, see list of characters there) thought that Saxifragales lacked any "diagnostic" morphological features. Carlsward et al. (2011) suggest apomorphies for all internal branches of Saxifragales, and many of these are flagged as such below (pollen characters are not yet included). Doyle (2012) suggested that tricolpate pollen was "retained" in many Saxifragales.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Caterpillars of Papilionidae-Parnassiinae are quite common here (Simonsen et al. 2011; Condamine et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Roots are diarch (Van Tieghem &amp; Douliot 1888). Saxifragales commonly have scalariform perforation plates, lateral pitting that is mostly scalariform or opposite, bordered pits, etc., but whether these are synapomorphies is unclear (Jian et al. [2006] characterise the largely unresolved woody members and the Saxifraceae + Crassulaceae clades in terms of their wood anatomy). Leaf teeth are basically rosid,
although those of <i>Cercidiphyllum</i> are described as being more or less chloranthoid (not very
different), while Hamamelidaceae can have teeth with a clear, glandular apex
(fothergilloid) and those of Altingiaceae are platanoid (basically, the higher order
lateral veins do not quite make it to the tooth - Hickey &amp; Wolfe 1975; <i>Tetracarpaea</i>
is similar, also lacking such veins - Hils et al. 1988). Despite appearances, the floral apex in nearly all taxa studied is reportesd to be
flat or concave (Fishbein et al. 2000; Soltis &amp; Hufford 2002; D. Soltis et al. 2003b; Soltis et al. 2005b), although Wurdack and Davis (2009) suggested that this was not the case for Peridiscaceae.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For information on the hamamelids as it was
beginning to be realised that they might have to be split, see Crane and
Blackmore (1989). For
pollen, see Hideux and Ferguson (1976), Zavada and Dilcher (1986); floral

and Gregory (1998); for seed coat, Krach (1976); and for general morphology, see Hermsen et al. (2006b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Most of Saxifragales as circumscribed here have long been apparent in molecular
phylogenies (e.g. D. Soltis et al. 1997; D. Soltis &amp; P. Soltis 1997), although support for the clade is not always very strong (D. Soltis et al. 2013). Within Saxifragales relationships other than the Saxifragaceae/Crassulaceae clade ("S.-C. clade" below) have been unclear for some time, and even now many of the deeper nodes remain poorly supported (D. Soltis et al. 2013).  However, support for the S.-C. clade and relationships within it is generally strong. The relationships [[Crassulaceae [Tetracarpaeaceae
[Penthoraceae + Haloragaceae]] [[Saxifragaceae [Iteaceae + Pterostemonaceae]]]
Grossulariaceae]] were found by Morgan &amp; Soltis (1993); support for a [<i>Pterostemon</i> + <i>Itea</i>] clade (= Iteaceae)  is strong (e.g. Soltis et al. 2007a: see below). <i>Aphanopetalum</i> (ex Cunoniaceae) is to be included in the Crassulaceae et al. clade.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although Hilu et al. (2003: <i>mat</i>K) did not recover the S.-C. clade, there was no strong support for alternative placements; Cercidiphyllaceae and Daphniphyllaceae were sister taxa, with moderate jacknife support. Hermsen et al. (2006b), who included both molecular and morphological (the latter also from selected fossils) data, also recovered a S.-C. clade, while all other  families were in a clade sister to this. [<i>Paeonia</i> + <i>Daphniphyllum</i>] and [Cercidiphyllaceae + Altingiaceae] were clades, but with very weak support (<50% bootstrap). <i>Paeonia</i> was linked with moderate support to the Crassulaceae clade, or, more weakly, with the S.-C. clade in some analyses in Fishbein et al. (2001); the latter relationship also appeared in a study by Fishbein and Soltis (2004), while Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016) found some support for a position as sister to [Cercidiphyllaceae [Dapniphyllaceae [Altingiaceae + Hamamelidaceae]]], relationships with even less support.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In none of these analyses were Peridiscaceae included. This family was an unexpected addition to Saxifragales, and they had been placed in Malpighiales by Savolainen et al. (2000a: see A.P.G. II 2003). However, Davis and Chase (2004; see also Soltis et al. 2007a) found that the family belonged here, adding <i>Soyauxia</i>, previously placed in Medusandraceae, while Wurdack and Davis (2009) added <i>Medusandra</i> itself. <i>Paeonia</i> was linked with low support to <i>Peridiscus</i> by Davis and Chase (2004). D. Soltis et al. (2007b) were unable to recover stable relationships among the woody Saxifragales, long branch attraction (to Paeoniaceae and Peridiscaceae) possibly occurring; depending on the analysis, a [Peridiscaceae + Paeoniaceae] clade made Hamamelidaceae paraphyletic, or Peridiscaceae were sister to all other Saxifragales. Despite the addition of more data, Jian et al. (2006) still found it difficult to resolve relationships between the woody members, although it appeared that Peridiscaceae might be sister to the rest of the order, and Paeoniaceae sister to the S.-C. clade. Similar relationships were recovered by Soltis et al. (2011, see also Moore et al. 2011), but support for the position of Paeoniaceae was weak; other relationships with Saxifragales that they found agree with the topology described below. Li (2008) also found little support for many relationships in the order, including the association of Paeoniaceae with the Crassulaceae group that appeared in some analyses, while Paeoniaceae were again associated with the S.-C. clade, but with litttle support, by M. Sun et al. (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">However, Jian et al. (2008: see also Qiu et al. 2010, slight differences [placement of Hamamelidaceae]), using a variety of large data sets (some with over 50,000 bp) and analyses, found strong maximum likelihood and Bayesian support for the topology used here, although <i>Paeonia</i> in particular moved around the tree in some parsimony analyses.  There is little morphological support for the basal branches, pretty much par for the course, although characters can be optimised to positions on a number of the shallower branches (c.f. Hermsen et al. 2006b). A study by Qi et al. (2012) that focused on <i>Cercidiphyllum</i> found a rather different set of relationships, including the paraphyly of Hamamelidaceae, but posterior probabilities were low, while in a <i>rbc</i>L analysis by Breteler et al. (2015), with a focus on Medusandraceae, but not including <i>Paeonia</i>, not only were Medusandraceae not basal (but there was no particular support for an alternative position), but <i>Leea</i> was placed within the order...</p>  

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some molecular analyses have placed the hitherto unplaced Cynomoriaceae in Saxifragales, perhaps in the Crassulaceae area, although with little support (Nickrent 2002; Nickrent et al. 2005), however, Barkman et al. (2007) found no support for a position in this order - but none for any particular position at all. A position in Saxifragales was rejected by Jian et al. (2008), who preferred to place them in Santalales; Balanophoraceae, with which Cynomoriaceae have been associated in the past, are certainly to be included there (see also Nickrent et al. 2005). Recently Cynomoriaceae have been placed in Rosales as sister to Rosaceae based on analysis of chloroplast inverted repeat sequences (Moraceae were the only other family in the order examined), and with strong support; Cynomoriaceae were certainly to be excluded from Saxifragales (good sampling) and several other rosid orders (Z.-H. Zhang et al. 2009; see also Moore et al. 2011). Depending on the mitochondrial gene analyzed by Qiu et al. (2010), Cynomoriaceae were placed with Saxifragales (<i>mat</i>R, <i>nad</i>5) or Sapindales (<i>atp</i>1, <i>rps</i>3). Naumann et al. (2013) placed Cynomoriaceae in Saxifragales as sister to [Paeoniaceae + Altingiaceae], the only other Saxifragales in the study, but representatives of the other clades to which Cynomoriaceae might be related were also included, while they are sister to the  S.-C. clade in Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016), but with little support. The inclusion of Cynomoriaceae in Saxifragales has been confirmed by Bellot et al. (2016) using genes from all three compartments, although exactly where it is to be placed is still unclear.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Saxifragales include Hamamelidaceae, thought to be a key
group classically linking the Englerian Amentiferae (usually dioecious or
monoecious woody plants with an ament, or catkin, with small flowers, and
sometimes believed to be primitive), to &quot;dicots&quot; with more conventional flowers (e.g. Endress 1967; Frohne &amp;
Jensen 1992). However, the old Amentiferae, included in Cronquist's (1981) Hamamelidae, are
now in several bits, mostly in the rosids, of which one is here - see also Fagales, the major part of Amentiferae, Malpighiales
(Salicaceae), Rosales (&quot;Urticales&quot;), etc. (Qiu et al. 1998a). For the woody Saxifragaceae, now similarly widely distributed, see below; many iridoid-positive and/or tenuinucellate members are now in the asterids, but most iridoid-negative, herbaceous and/or crassinucellate
members remain here. Ironically, three families of Saxifragales s. str. are reliably reported to have iridoids (how many origins?) and are the only families outside asterids with them. Daphniphyllanae, Saxifraganae and Hamamelidanae, in which Takhtajan (1997) placed most of the families that are in Saxifragales here, are all in his Hamamelididae.</p>

<ul><li>Peridiscaceae are tropical trees with entire or shallowly toothed stipulate leaves. The racemose inflorescences have small flowers, the gynoecium has apical ovules, and the styluli are short. The capsular fruit has a single, large seed with a dark-colored but not very hard coat; the embryo is very small and embedded in cartilagineous endosperm.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Peridiscaceae are a very poorly known and superficially heterogeneous group. For mycorrhizae in <i>Soyauxia</i>, see Bechem et al. (2014). I have not seen <i>Whittonia</i>, but Metcalfe (1962) gives some details of its anatomy. The vascular pitting of <i>Medusandra</i> is scalariform and the pits are bordered (Metcalfe 1952). Note that the
leaves are almost certainly simple, not unifolioliate (c.f. Brenan 1952;
Hutchinson 1973); the rather swollen apex of the petiole is like that of many
Euphorbiaceae, <i>Hydnocarpus</i>, <i>Octoknema</i>, etc., which are not usually
described as being possibly unifoliolate. Petiole anatomy in the region of the pulvinus is complex. For epidermal wax crystals, see Ditsch and Barthlott (1997). The bracteoles are often inconspicuous (c.f. Cronquist 1981). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Peridiscus</i> and <i>Whittonia</i> have monothecal anthers, probably derived within the family. The flowers of <i>Medusandra</i> have long and conspicuous staminodes borne opposite the sepals, hence the generic name. Breteler et al. (2015) discuss  stamninodes and nectaries in Peridiscaceae; they suggest that in <i>Soyauxia</i>, at least, what had been called a disc is staminodial. The basic seed morphology/anatomy of <i>Soyauxia</i> and <i>Peridiscus</i>, from either side of the Atlantic, are almost identical, although the two are vegetatively very different - <i>Peridiscus</i> is sometimes even identified as Menispermaceae! </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">See Metcalfe (1952b, 1962) and Miller (1975) for anatomy and Soltis et al. (2007b) and Bayer and Dressler (2014) for general information.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Relationships are [<i>Medusandra</i> [<i>Peridiscus</i> + <i>Soyauxia</i>]] (Wurdack &amp; Davies 2009; Breteler et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Peridiscaceae were included in Violales-Flacourtiaceae by Takhtajan (1997), and a similar position was suggested by A.P.G. III (2003); <i>Soyauxia</i> in particular has been associated with Medusandraceae or with Flacourtiaceae (Malpighiales). <i>Medusandra</i> itself was tentatively included in Malpighiales by Soltis et al. (2005b), certainly, the serrate leaf blades and the cauline stipules suggest relationships
other than to Santalales or Santalanae (c.f. Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan

<ul><li>Paeoniaceae are perennial herbs or shrublets that are
recognisable by their rather large, &plusmn; ternately compound, exstipulate leaves,
and large flowers. The latter have
sepals and petals intergrading, numerous centrifugal stamens, a prominent disc, and separate
carpels. The fruit is a follicle and
the seeds are fleshy.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For the evolution and biogeography of the genus, see Sang et al. (1997).

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Seed Dispersal.</u> The testa is thick, fleshy and coloured, and in at least some species (<i>Paeonia anomala</i>, <i>P. mlokosewitschii</i>) its blackish colour contrasts with the red of the testa of partly developed and unfertilized seeds when the follicle opens. The funicle is also fleshy. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> According to Hiepko (1965, see also Endress 2010c) <i>Paeonia</i> lacks petals - presumably because of the spiral arrangement and vasculature of the perianth members. There is a prominent lobed disc, but in <i>P. officinalis</i>, not other species, it does not secrete nectar (Hiepko 1966; Erbar 2014 and references). Johri et al. (1992) called the
micropyle exostomal, however, the inner integument, too, partly forms the
micropyle.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Both embryo sac and embryo development are very distinctive. The embryo sacs (there is often more than one per ovule) develop from megaspore mother cells that are deeply embedded in a massive nucellus plus nucellar cap, and they elongate considerably towards the micropyle as they develop; the secondary endosperm nucleus is huge (see e.g. Yakovlev &amp; Yoffe 1957; Cave et al. 1961; Walters 1962). The funicle is also fleshy, and there may be a small rim aril at the apex. There is no tegmen.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Tamura (2006), for the perianth, see also Brouland (1935); for general floral morphology, see Hiepko (1964, 1966) and Leins and Erbar (1991); Yakovlev and Yoffe (1957), Tiagi (1970) and Takhtajan
(1988) provide much information on ovules and seeds. For an account of the genus, see Hong (2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Paeoniales were included in
Ranunculidae (Takhtajan 1997), and a relationship between Paeoniaceae and
Ranunculaceae in particular has often been suggested (Takhtajan 1997; Mabberley 1997 included <i>Glaucidium</i>
[see Ranunculaceae here] in Paeoniaceae) because of gross floral similarities between the two. However,
they differ in the nature of the petals and nectaries, the development of
the androecium, numerous embryological features, etc. (e.g. Tiagi 1970); there are no dipteran agromyzid leaf miners on Paeoniaceae, although they are common on Ranunculaceae. Dilleniales, in which
Paeoniaceae were placed by Cronquist (1981; see Corner 1946), have multistaminate and
centrifugal androecia, but differ in gynoecial development, nectary morphology, etc..</p>


<p><a name="AlttoDap"><u>[Altingiaceae [Hamamelidaceae [Cercidiphyllaceae + Daphniphyllaceae]]]</u></a>: (route I iridoids +); cuticle waxes as tubules, nonacosan-10-ol the main wax; buds perulate; inflorescence racemose, <b class="apo">flowers sessile</b>; anthers &plusmn; valvate, connectives apically protruding; <b class="apo">seeds winged</b>; <b class="apo">embryo long</b>; germination epigeal and phanerocotylar.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Moore et al. (2010: 95% HPD) suggested crown group ages of  (103-)98(-94) m.y. for this node; aroud 98.7 m.y. is the age in Tank et al. (2015: Table S2) and (113.7-)106(-99.3) or 90 m.y. (Jian et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b>  <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Maslova (2010; see also Maslova et al. 2012) saw fossil Platanaceae and Hamamelidaceae, in particular Hamamelidaceae-Altingioideae, as being related and springing from a polymorphic ancestral group. Maslova's Hamamelidales included Hamamelidaceae, with a number of fossil genera, Platanaceae and several more fossil genera, and <b>Bogutchantaceae</b> (for further details, see <a href="protealesweb.html#Platanaceae" target="home">Platanaceae</a>) while <a name="Sarbaicarpaceae"><b>Sarbaicarpaceae</b></a> N. Maslova and <a name="Kasicarpaceae"><b>Kasicarpaceae</b></a> N. Maslova were both placed in the extinct order <a name="Sarbaicarpales"><b>Sarbaicarpales</b></a> N. Maslova, part of the immediately larger group. Variation in this whole group is complex, and whether some characters reflected common ancestry or parallel variation was unclear (Maslova 2010: p. 1456 for a summary). Vavilov's Law of parallel variation was invoked (Maslova 2010: table 2), and it helped explain the "isomorphic polymorphisms" observed in platanoids and altingioids.  Maslova (2010) was inclined to reject molecule-based hypotheses of relationships, and Proteaceae barely entered into the discussion; it is unclear what to make of these fossils and ideas.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Diversification within this clade may have occurred within 3-6 m.y. (Jian et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> There are a number of reports of delayed fertilization from members of all four families, although not in <i>Paeonia</i> (Endress 2110c, but esp. Sogo &amp; Tobe 2006d and references), hence the placement of this feature here.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Raffinose and stachyose are common oligosaccharides in phloem exudate in this clade (Daphniphyllaceae not studied: Zimmermann &amp; Ziegler 1975). Hufford and Endress (1989; see also Hersen et al. 2006b) discuss anather morphology and anatomy in detail; members of this clade can have obviously valvate anthers, as in Hamamelidoideae, or the stomium may simply divide at the two ends of the theca, or at least at the base of the theca. Wheeler et al. (2011) summarize what is known of wood anatomy in the clade.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Ickert-Bond and Wen (2006) suggested that the crown-group age for the family can be dated to somewhere between 54 and 19.5 m.y. ago.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The fossil <i>Microaltingia</i> (ca 90 m.y.o.) has prolate, tricolpate pollen grains with a coarsely reticulate exine, a more or less superior ovary, ovaries with 8 or more ovules per carpel, and perhaps unwinged seeds; it may have been pollinated by insects (Z.-K. Zhou et al. 2001).  If correctly assigned here - sister to the extant representatives of the family (Ickert-Bond et al. 2005, 2007) - it is yet another fossil with interestingly plesiomorphous features (see also Calycanthaceae, Platanaceae, Fagaceae, etc.). See also Friis et al. (2011) for discussion; i.a. they note that there are 2-3 series of sterile organs on the ovary, and prefer to think of the fossil as stem Altingiaceae.</p>


<ul><li>Altingiaceae are monoecious, deciduous trees that may
be recognised by their spirally-arranged, usually palmately-lobed leaves with petiolar stipules
and by their capitate inflorescences. The buds have scales, and the plants often produce resins.</ul>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Ickert-Bond and Wen (2006) give dates for divergence of clades within Altingiaceae; the basal split in the family is between the European + American and East Asian clades.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> There can be confusion between the exudates of Styracaceae, and the genus <i>Styrax</i> in particular (form which benzoin oil, gum benjamin, etc.), and Altingiaceae (from which, storax) - not to mention <i>Lindera benzoin</i> (Lauraceae). Secretory canals are also reported
from <i>Mytilaria</i> (Hamamelidaceae s. str.). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are strongly vascularized structures ("phyllomes") interior to the staminal whorl; these may be staminodia, nectaries or organs <i>sui generis</i>. The orientation of the carpels varies (Bogle 1986). For the interpretation of the knobs, etc., surrounding the carpellate flowers, see Ickert-Bond et al. (2005). This and Hamamelidaceae -
&quot;micropyle faces upwards&quot;?</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Endocarpial cells are thickened and elongated transverse to the long axis of the fruit, and they look almost palisade in transverse section. The testa is notably thinner than that of most Hamamelidaceae. Ickert-Bond et al. (2005) suggest that in <i>Liquidambar</i> the exotegmen "constitutes most of the seed coat", although it is absent in most Hamamelidaceae, a point also made by others (e.g. Mohana Rao 1974). This is not immediately evident in the sections presented (e.g. Fig. 9, G-J) nor in Melikian (1973) and Z.-Y. Zhang and Wen (1996), but if confirmed (see e.g. Ickert-Bond et al. 2007) it will be another sharp difference from the more or less massively mesotestal seeds of most Hamamelidaceae.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For information about Hamamelidaceae s.l., see Bogle (1986: floral morphology, etc.),

(1993: general).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Shi et al. (2001) present a molecular phylogeny of Altingiaceae, and this suggests that there is only one genus, in contrast to morphological phylogenies (Ickert-Bond et al. 2005, 2007).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> It is best that a single genus be recognised, both because of phylogeny (e.g. Ickert-Bond &amp; Wen 2006) and because species of the two genera that have been recognized, <i>Liquidambar</i> and <i>Altingia</i>, can hybridize (Wu et al. 2010). See Ickert-Bond and Wen (2013) for a taxonomic synopsis of the family.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> <i>Allonia decandra</i>, a fossil probably to be placed in crown-group Loropetalineae (Hamamalidoideae), was collected from ca 83 m.y.o. rocks of the Cretaceous-Campanian in the eastern U.S.A., it has twice as many
stamens as petals and a lobed disc adaxial to them (Magall&oacute;n-Puebla et al.
1996: Friis et al. 2011); the seeds are rather angled, so there may have been more than one per loculus.

<p>Synonymy: <b>Fothergillaceae</b>
Nuttall, <b>Parrotiaceae</b> Horaninow</p>

<ul><li>Hamamelidaceae are trees or shrubs that may be recognised by their often
stellate or tufted hairs, their strongly stipulate leaves which often have &plusmn;
palmate venation; the bases of the branches are often swollen. Their smallish flowers are often borne in rather dense inflorescences,
and their capsules are bivalved, each valve being bilobed (= loculicidal + septicidal dehiscence). Their seeds are rather large  and have a hard, shiny, bicolored testa; they are sometimes forcibly ejected. </ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For the early Caenozoic fossil history of what are now East Asian endemic members of the family, see Manchester et al. (2009), for other literature on fossils, see Friis et al. (2011).</p> 



<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the evolution of the flower in Hamamelidoideae, see Magall&oacute;n (2007; fossils included, optimisation on to more than one topology). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> There is considerable variation in floral morphology. <i>Corylopsis</i> has rather ordinary-looking flowers with obovate petals, although this morphology is probably derived. In <i>Parrotiopsis</i> there are showy inflorescence bracts, and these are bright red in <i>Rhodoleia</i>, and there the whole inflorescence is very like the flower of, say, Calycanthaceae. Petals may be lost, as in <i>Fothergilla</i> where the inflorescence is made conspicuous by the plump and showy white filaments (see Endress 1978 for a discussion of the floral morphology of those Hamamelidaceae without a perianth). Nectar is a common reward here, but the nectaries are very variable in morphology (Endress 1993 and references). <i>Eustigma</i> has quite long white styluli and massive, purplish stigmas that are the most conspicuous parts of the flower.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fertilization in Hamamelidaceae is often much delayed.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> For the phylogeny of hormoraphidine aphids, notable gallers on Hamamelidoideae with ca 13 genera of aphids known from <i>Distylium</i> alone, see J. Chen et al. (2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> What is going on with the
growth of <i>Exbucklandia</i>? There is variation in the direction of initiation of the stamens in multistaminate androecia (Endress 1976); it can be centripetal (<i>Matudaea</i>) or centrifugal (<i>Fothergilla</i>). <i>Exbucklandia</i> is reported to have a remarkably long outer integument, although it is developed only on one side of the micropyle (Kaul &amp; Kapil 1974).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Much additional information can be found in Endress's early work
(1967a [general, comparison with Betulaceae, <i>Corylopsis</i> is the link], 1970 [inflorescence], 1971 [inflorescence, flower], 1976, [floral development], 1993 [general]). For petiole anatomy, see Skvortsova (1960), for embryology, see Kapil and Kaul (1974: <i>Parrotiopsis</i>); for seed anatomy, see Mohana Rao (1974), Z.-Y. Zhang and Wen (1996), and Benedict et al. (2008: also fruits and fossils), and Mag&aacute;llon et al. (2001 and references) and Zhao and Li (2008) for fossils.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> A clade including Exbucklandioideae and Mytilarioideae was apparent only in the analysis of ITS data and good sampling (75% bootstrap, better if gaps scored as a fifth character state: Li et al. 1999b; c.f. Shi et al. 1998); the genera included have in the past been placed in three subfamilies.  With <i>rbc</i>L data, <i>Mytilaria</i> alone was rather weakly supported as sister to [Disanthoideae + Hamamelidoideae] (Li et al. 1999a). However, a later two-gene analysis resulted in strong support for the clades represented by the four subfamilies above and their relationships (Li 2008) as did the study by Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Hamamelidoideae [Corylopsideae (monotypic) + Loropetaleae (weak support)] were sister to the rest, but tribal interrelationships had for the most part only weak support (Li &amp; Bogle 2001; Li 2008). See Xie et al. (2010) for the phylogeny and biogeography of <i>Hamamelis</i>, which, despite having similar petals to those of <i>Loropetalum</i>, is not immediately related.</p>

<ul><li>Cercidiphyllaceae are deciduous trees that may be recognised by the sharp
distinction between long-lived short shoots with prominent and close leaf scars and long shoots; the
leaves are more or less opposite, stipulate, and with palmate venation. The plant is dioecious, and what appear to be flowers lack a perianth; staminate "flowers" have several stamens and carpellate "flowers" have 2-8 carpels with long, decurrent stigmas. The
fruits are follicles with winged seeds.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For the early Caenozoic fossil history of <i>Cercidiphyllum</i>, see Manchester et al. (2009) and Friis et al. (2011).  Qi et al. (2012) found substantial genome structure in populations of <i>Cercidiphyllum</i>, which is by no means a relict.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Palaeocene fossils (<i>Joffrea</i>) have 2-carpellate flowers borne on an elongated axis
with the adaxial sutures of the carpels facing each other (Crane &amp; Stockey
1985, 1986; see also Friis et al. 2011). Staminate flowers of fossils may have five stamens and a pentamerous perianth (Kvacek 2008).</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Takhtajan (1997) described the venation of
leaves on the long shoots as being pinnate, but the main secondary veins all arise
within 5(-10) mm of the base.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Krassilov and Lowen (2007) thought that the flower of <i>Cercidiphyllum</i> was unlike that of other Saxifragales (see also  Maskova 2010). The &quot;flowers&quot; of today's species can be interpreted as pseudanthia. Each carpel represents a carpellate flower, indeed, the carpels are sometimes slightly separated from one another on the stout green axis, that of the "pedicel"=inflorescence. Both individual carpels and groups of stamens are subtended by bracts and are more or less decussately arranged. Yan et al. (2007) suggest that the bract is "really" a tepal because it is developmentally so different from the vegetative leaves, although it may have teeth or be almost bilobed. However, it is most likely that the structure is a bract, and that the suture of the carpel is adaxial with respect to the floral  axis that originally bore it.  Soltis et al. (2005: fig. 6:11) suggest perhaps inadvertently that the gynoecium is partly inferior. </b>

<ul><li>Crassulaceae are recognisable by their succulent
herbaceous or soft-stemmed habit, and their flowers, which have the same number
of sepals, petals and carpels; the latter are more or less free and have
nectariferous scales at their bases. The fruits are usually follicles.</ul>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> <i>Aeonium</i>, a largely Macaronesian genus with the most endemic species there, has striking growth forms, some arborescent, each of which seems to have evolved just once (Mes &amp; t'Hart 1996; Jorgensen &amp; Olesen 2001). Diversification in the largely Europaean <i>Jovibarba</i>/<i>Sempervivum</i> clade is a result of vicariance, long-distance dispersal, and edaphic specialization (Klein &amp; Kadereit 2015). <i>Rhodiola</i> is likely to have evolved  on the Quinghai-Tibet Plateau (J.-Q. Zhang et al. 2014b). Crassulaceae are found on relatively few oceanic islands, but they have evolved a relatively large number of single island endemics (Lenzner et al. 2017).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The distinctive wood, which lacks rays and has very short vessel elements with annular and helical thickening, is probably paedomorphic (t'Hart &amp; Koek-Noorman 1989); plant chemistry, in particular the presence of hydrolyzable tannins and the absence of non-hydrolyzable tannins, as in other woody Saxifragales, is consistent with this idea (Thiede &amp; Eggli 2006).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There have been several origins of sympetaly in Sedoideae s.l. ('t Hart et al. 1999; Carrillo-Reyes et al. 2009); both it and epipetaly tend to be weak. The increase in numbers of flower parts in some Sedoideae - some have a multistaminate androecium - is in the context of an increased merousness of the whole flower; the relation between the number of parts of each whorl is like that of other basic core eudicot flowers (see also the <a href="icacinalesweb.html#euasterids" target="home">euasterid</a> clade), i.e. K = C = G; A = 2x C.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">All ca 200 species of the <i>Echeveria</i> group (Sempervivoideae) appear to be interfertile, a remarkable situation apparently without parallel in flowering plants (Uhl 1992). For hybridization in <i>Sempervivum</i>, see Klein and Kadereit (2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For suggestions as to the base chromosome numbers of the family and of its major clades, see Mort et al. (2001).

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Members of the family are an important component of the vegetation of the winter rainfall Succulent Karoo of south west Africa (Ogburn &amp; Edwards 2010).</p> 



<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is common throughout the family (Winter &amp; Smith 1996a and references; Pilon-Smits et al. 1996). It has also been reported from aquatic species of <i>Crassula</i> (Keeley 1998). For CAM variation within <i>Kalanchoe</i>, see Gehrig et al. (2001), Kluge and Brulfert (1996) and Mioto et al. (2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some species of <i>Kalanchoe</i> produce plantlets in notches at the margin of the leaf blade; these have rather aptly been called foliar embryos (Yarborough 1932). Both embryogenetic and organogenetic pathways have been coopted, and the young plantlets have cotyledon-like first leaves; unlike seeds, plantlets show no dormancy, a gene that induces dormancy in <i>Arabidopsis</i> not being functional (Garc&ecirc;s et al. 2014). Species in which development of plantlets is constitutive, i.e. plantlets are produced without the plant being damaged, do not produce viable seed (Garc&ecirc;s et al. 2007).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Anthocyanin is also found in the roots of Saxifragaceae, as well as Melastomataceae, Balsaminaceae,
Asteraceae, Droseraceae, and Francoaceae (Krach 1976; Molisch 1928). Sedoheptulose is the most abundant sugar in Crassulaceae; isocitrate is common, unlike in other succulents (Thiede &amp; Eggli 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The extent of rayless wood in the family should be confirmed (Carlquist 2015b).   The sieve tube plastids are a distinctive variant, lacking starch, the S<sub>0</sub> type (Behnke 1988a). For (mistaken) reports of cortical vascular bundles, see Thiede and Eggli (2006). The leaf blade usually lacks palisade tissue, and there are often stomata on both sides. The stomata may also be heliocytic, with an
additional ring of distinct cells outside a basically anisocytic
configuration.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> There is sometimes only a single vascular trace to the calyx members (t'Hart &amp; Koek-Noorman 1989). Anthers early in development are introrse, but often at maturity the sporangia are equidistant from one another (Wassmer 1955). According to D. Soltis et al. (2003b), the ovary is secondarily superior. Although this seems unlikely, the very base of the ovary is sometimes inferior, and the carpels, apparently free, are slightly connate at the base; a small amount of axial tissue is also apparent in the gynoecial region of some taxa (Wassmer 1955, q.v. for gynoecial details). The nectary is &plusmn; receptacular in origin (Erbar 2014 and references). The nucellar epidermal cells tend to be large and more or less radially elongated in Crassuloideae (in particular) and Kalancho&ouml;ideae; in some Sedoideae megaspores elongate - sometimes those from the same megaspore mother cell - and grow towards the micropyle, and there and in <i>Kalanchoe</i> two embryo sacs may develop (Mauritzon 1933: much information; Subramanyan 1968). Haustoria from places other than the massive suspensor are reported for Crassulaceae (Mickesell 1990). Distinctive compound plasmodesmata in the suspensor cell walls have been found in some Sempervivoideae, although their distribution within the family is unclear (Kozieradzka-Kiszkurno et al. 2011). The testal cells of <i>Crassula</i> often have a single papilla and sinuous anticlinal walls (e.g. Bywater &amp; Wickens 1983). There is no tegmen. Spongberg (1977) notes that the endosperm is usually scanty, while Mabberley (1997) describes it
as being copious; the former is correct.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general recent accounts of the family, see Eggli (2003: enumeration of all species) and in particular Thiede and Eggli (2006); for chemistry, see Stevens (1995) and Bjarnholt et al. (2008: non-cyanogenic glucosides), for anatomy, see Gregory (1998) and Jensen (1968: nodal anatomy, variable), for floral development, see Nelson (1990), and for embryology, etc., see Rombach (1911), Vignon-F&eacute;tr&eacute; (1968) and Subramanyam (1970).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> The basic phylogenetic structure of the family seems fairly well established (e.g. van Ham 1995; van Ham &amp; 't Hart 1998; Mort et al. 2001, 2010 for a summary; Mayuzumi &amp; Ohba 2004). The rather highly derived Crassuloideae are sister to the rest of the family; <i>Kalanchoe</i> and relatives are sister to the rest of Sedoideae (e.g. Mort et al. 2001; Mort 2002; Thiede &amp; Eggli 2006). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Crassuloideae, <i>Tillaea</i> is polyphyletic and embedded within <i>Crassula</i> (Mort et al. 2009; Mort et al. 2010). For the phylogeny of <i>Kalanchoe</i>, see Gehrig et al. (2001) and Kluge and Brulfert (1996).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Sedum</i> appears in five of the seven main clades apparent in phylogenetic analyses of Sempervivoideae (van Ham 1995; van Ham &amp; 't Hart 1998; Mayuzumi &amp; Ohba 2004; Nikulin et al. 2016), and to make it monophyletic, genera like <i>Aeonium</i>, <i>Echeveria</i>, <i>Villadia</i>, <i>Sempervivum</i> and <i>Dudleya </i> would all have to be included. Within the <i>Acre</i> clade of <i>Sedum</i>, most New World Sedoideae as well as all the old Echeverioideae in the study formed a single clade, although it was only poorly supported (Carrillo-Reyes et al. 2009). For relationships of the <i>Acre</i> clade and other east Asian Sedoideae, see Mayuzumi and Ohba (2004). The limits of <i>Graptopetalum</i> are unclear, and there was little strong support along the backbone of the tree (Acevedo-Rosas et al. 2004). For relationships within <i>Dudleya</i>, probably monophyletic, see Yost et al. (2014), and for those within <i>Rhodiola</i>, see J.-Q. Zhang et al. (2014a, b).  Klein and Kadereit (2015) resolved relationships within the <i>Jovibarba</i>/<i>Sempervivum</i> clade, but chloroplast and nuclear data gave trees with different topologies.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Within Sempervivoideae, generic limits are unclear (an understatement), and
many genera, some previously placed in what were considered to be different subfamilies, e.g. Sedoideae
and Echeverioideae, hybridise (e.g. Uhl 1976; 't Hart et al. 1999). Thiede and Eggli (2006) provide a guide through the chaos, and although they prefer to retain a paraphyletic <i>Sedum</i> pro tem., this wil have to be dismembered or its circumscription much enlarged - the extremes are a <i>Sedum</i> that is monotypic or that encompasses almost two thirds of the whole family, and Klein (in Kadereit et al. 2016) inclined towards the former solution. For <i>Kalanchoe</i>, see Descoings (2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Crassulaceae have been linked with Rosaceae and Podostemaceae because of embryological similarities... (Rombach 1911).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The two species may have diverged (19.6-)11(-4.7) m.y.a. (L.-Y. Chen et al. 2014a).</p>

<ul><li>Aphanopetalaceae are more or less scrambling shrubs with prominently lenticellate stems, opposite and more or less serrate leaves with minute "stipules", and axillary inflorescences. The flowers are more or less apetalous but have four large, white sepals that enlarge somewhat in fruit; the fruit itself has a single seed.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The ray parenchyma
stores starch. Two small bundles soon diverge from
the main leaf trace. It is unclear if the stipules "are" stipules or colleters (Kubitzki 2006b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">As in Saxifragaceae and
Iteaceae, the vascular trace in the petal plane gives a branch to the lateral
sepal position, also carpel wall and lateral carpel traces and a single stamen trace; the
trace in the sepal plane supplies the carpel wall and median carpel bundle and provides a
stamen bundle.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some information is taken from  Kubitzki (2006b: general),  Jensen (1968: vascular system), Dickison (1980b: nodal anatomy), Dickison et al. (1994: anatomy), Bensel

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The crown-group age of this clade is estimated to be (50.9-)42(-33.5) m.y. (L.-Y. Chen et al. 2014a).</p>


<p>Synonymy: <b>Cercodiaceae</b> Jussieu, <b>Myriophyllaceae</b>
Schultz-Schultzenstein </p>


<ul><li>Haloragaceae are rather small, usually monoecious, often more or less
herbaceous plants. Their leaves are
serrate or deeply lobed, small, and often opposite or whorled, and their flowers are small (<i>Haloragodendron</i> is an exception) and have
penicillate stigmas.</ul>

  <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For the ages of some intercontinental disjunctions within Haloragaceae, see Les et al. (2003).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Proserpinaca</i> fossils are common in Europe and Asia, but the genus is now restricted to the New World, where it is scattered (L.-Y. Chen et al. 2014a: Fig. 1).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The family may have an Australian origin (e.g. Moody &amp; Les 2007), and there has since been substantial dispersal, especially of the aquatic taxa - probably by birds (L.-Y. Chen et al. 2014a, q.v. for more details and dates).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> The aquatic habit has evolved at least twice in the family (L.-Y. Chen et al. 2014a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> In some species of <i>Glischrocaryon</i> the whole inflorescence is coloured. However, details of its pollination are unknown; wind pollination is likely in other Haloragaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Nodal anatomy was observed in <i>Haloragis
erecta</i> and <i>Laurembergia</i>, vernation in the first. Pelargonidin occurs in leaves, as in
Saxifragaceae (Doyle &amp; Sogin 1988). Adventitious roots arise between the leaves in <i>Haloragis</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Trihaloragis</i> has flowers in which all whorls are trimerous, very unusual in eudicots; Moody and Les (2007) point out the extensive variation in floral merism in the family. <i>Myriophyllum</i> appears to have endostomal ovules (Batygina
et al. 1985), while Bawa (1970) noted that the archesporial cell was hypodermal, i.e. the ovule is tenuinucellate/there is no parietal tissue. Nijalingappa (1975) described the embryo sac of <i>Haloragis micrantha</i> as having a hypostase; there is definitely a postament. Corner
(1976) described the endosperm as being starchy. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Orchard (1975: Antipodean taxa, inc. much detail about floral anatomy, etc.), Orchard (1990; Australian taxa), and Kubitzki (2006b); for other information, see Orchard and
Keighery (1993: <i>Meziella</i>) and Praglowski (1970: pollen).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> See Moody and Les (2001, 2004 and especially 2007, in the latter study nuclear ITS and chloroplast genes in some conflict) for relationships within the family. The [<i>Glischrocaryon</i> + <i>Haloragodendron</i>] clade is sister to other Haloragaceae (see also L.-Y. Chen et al. 2014a), although the reciprocal monophyly of the two genera is not certain. The rest of the family forms a single clade, but relationships within it are uncertain, <i>Meionectes</i> and <i>Proserpinaca</i> in particular not having well-supported positions (Moody &amp; Les 2007); the latter two genera are sister taxa, the combined clade being sister to the remainder (L.-Y. Chen et al. 2014a). The trimerous <i>Trihaloragis</i> is sister to all other members of this clade (Moody &amp; Les 2007). For the phylogeny of <i>Haloraghis</i> (and the disappearance of <i>Meziella</i>) see Moody and Les (2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> The monotypic Haloragales were placed near Saxifragales by Takhtajan (1997) or linked with Gunneraceae and placed next to Myrtales, as by Cronquist (1981). Historically Gunneraceae and Haloragaceae <a href="gunneralesweb.htm#Gunneraceae" target="home">q.v.</a> have often been associated, although their pollen is quite different (e.g. Praglowski 1970), the perianth of Gunneraceae is not differentiated into sepals and petals, etc..</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The fossil <i>Divisestylus</i>, from the late Cretaceous some 90 m.y. before present and perhaps part of the <i>Itea</i> clade, has five stamens opposite the sepals and ovaries and stigmas fused, but there are separate styles - just like <i>Itea</i>. However, the pollen is tricolpate and striate, suggesting that the the fossil is stem-group <i>Itea</i> (Hermsen et al. 2003; see also Friis et al. 2011). </p>


<ul><li><i>Pterostemon</i> looks rather rosaceous. It is
woody and has spiral, serrate, and stipulate leaves, and its leaf blades tend to be notably shiny. However, the distinctive conical to peltate glandular hairs, the exudate of which produces the shiny leaf surface, and the flowers,  which have spreading petals and a quite long, erect tube formed by five stamens with winged and toothed filaments and five staminodes, allow it to be easily recognised.</ul>

<ul><li><i>Itea</i> may be recognised by its stems with
chambered pith, spirally-arranged serrate leaves with superposed axillary buds,
paniculate to racemose inflorescences with rather small flowers, and
septicidal fruits the valves of which often remain attached by the stigma. The flowers have a hypanthium, the corolla
is valvate, and there are only two carpels.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The distinctive pollen of <i>Itea</i> is known fossil in Europe in the Eocene and somewhat later in North America (Hermsen et al. 2003); fossils in western North America have been dated to 59-42 m.y., although there is some uncertainty here, or ca 3.7 m.y. in Western Europe (Hermsen 2013).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b>  <i>Itea</i>: For the chemistry of <i>Itea</i>, see Bohm et al.
(1999). <i>Pterostemon</i> also has flavones, in this being like other Saxifragales. <i>Choristylis</i> (= <i>Itea</i>) lacks axial parenchyma.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The inflorescences of <i>Itea</i> may be terminal on rather short shoots. The ovule of <i>Itea</i> is sometimes described as being unitegmic, with the integument 6-7 cells across, but this appears to be incorrect (Kubitzki 2006b). Although the carpels are free initially, they become connate, even along the style (Ge et al. 2002), so perhaps the styles are more accurately described as being postgenitally connate styluli.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Pterostemon</i>: The pericyclic fibres of <i>Pterostemon</i> seem to be
weakly developed and the androecium is obdiplostemonous. Similar peltate glandular hairs are known
from Grossulariaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> <i>Tylerianthus crossmanensis</i>, ca 90 m.y.o. from the Upper Cretaceous of New Jersey, has been compared with Grossulariaceae, although it does not have a hypanthium (Friis et al. 2011 for references), but see Hydrangeaceae here.</p>

<ul><li>Grossulariaceae may be recognised by their lobed,
spiral leaves with broad bases, and flowers with a well-developed hypanthium, relatively large and colored sepals and smaller petals, a usually bicarpellate
gynoecium, and parietal placentation; the fruit is baccate.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b>  <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The genus probably originated in North America (references in Ebersbach et al. 2017). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> The fruits of <i>Ribes</i> are an important food for Andean frugivorous birds.  Several species of insects have been recorded as eating species of <i>Ribes</i> (Weigend 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> A number of fungi, including the ecomonically very important white pine blister rust (the basidiomycete <i>Cronartium ribicola</i>), spend part of their life cycle on the plants of this genus. In some places in North America attempts - largely unsuccessful - have been made to eradicate <i>Ribes</i> so as to disrupt the life cycle of this damaging fungus, <i>Ribes</i> harbouring the telial stage. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For non-cyanogenic &beta;- and &gamma;-hydroxynitrile glucosides, which are found along with cyanogenic &alpha;-hydroxynitrile glucosides, see Bjarnholt et al. (2008). Stem collenchyma is well developed.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Nectar glands  on the anthers are reported from some species. There is considerable variation in pollen morphology, and <i>Ribes divaricatum</i> has pentacolpo-diorate grains (Weigend 2006). The stylar bundles are ventral carpellar (Saxena 1969). Wronska-Pilarek (2001) described a cellulose-pectinous layer surrounding the seed; it was ca 6 cells across and made up of thin-walled, elongated cells, perhaps tegmic/nucellar in origin. Wronska-Pilarek (2001) also thought that the aril sometimes developed from placental tissus. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Additional information is taken from Weigend (2006: general), Stern et al. (1970) and Gregory (1998), both anatomy, Klopfer (1969a, 1973) and  Gelius (1967), floral morphology, and Mauritzon (1933) and Shamrov (1998), ovule/embryology.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Weigend et al. (2002) and Senters and Soltis (2003) suggest phylogenies for <i>Ribes</i>.</p>

<ul><li>Saxifragaceae can be recognised by their herbaceous
habit and gland-toothed leaves; stipules, when present, are often borne on the petiole
near the base. The flowers often have
2-3 carpels that are basally connate, although the styluli are clearly free, a well-developed nectariferous disc immediately surrounding the gynoecium is common, and the fruit is a
follicle or septicidal capsule.</ul>

<ul><li>Saxifragaceae can be confused with
Rosaceae; <i>Astilbe</i> (Saxifragaceae) and <i>Aruncus</i> (Rosaceae - Rosales) are
particularly similar. However, the carpels of former are usually two and basally connate rather than several to many and free, and the flowers have five or ten rather than fifteen to many stamens. Saxifragaceae and Rosaceae are not phylogenetically close.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b>  <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Deng et al. (2014) give dates for spilts in Saxifragaceae, while Ebersbach et al. (2017) give numerous dates for divergences within <i>Saxifraga</i> in particular.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Deng et al. (2014) discuss the biogeography of Saxifragaceae. They suggested that <i>Saxifragodes albowiana</i>, from southern South America, was sister to <i>Cascadia nuttallii</i>, from the Pacific Northwest, the two diverging slightly over 20 m.y.a. (Deng et al. 2014: c.f. the topology of Fig. 3, the dated DIVA tree, and Fig. 1; in the former [<i>Saxifragodes</i> + <i>Cascadia</i>] were sister to all other Heucheroideae, in the latter, they were part of the <i>Astilbe</i> et al. clade). Much  speciation in <i>Saxifraga</i> section <i>Ciliatae</i> is quite recent and associated with the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, with that of the ca 110 species of subsection <i>Hirculoideae</i> occuring in within the last two million years (Gao et al. 2015), while Deng et al. (2014) suggested that <i>S. bicuspidata</i>, from the Tierra del Fuego area, diverged from the rest of the genus ca 22 m.y.a., while <i>S. magellanica</i> from southern South America is embedded within the European section <i>Saxifraga</i> (Ebersbach et al. 2017). In the comprehensive study by Ebersbach et al. (2017), it was suggested that <i>Saxifraga</i> (and Saxifragaceae) originated in North America, although it is now particularly diverse in the Qinghai-Tibet area, with 200+ species, most in sections <i>Ciliatae</i> and <i>Porphyrion</i>. Most diversification in these clades has been dated to to (10-)7, 6(-4) m.y.o., and orogenesis of the Hengduan Mountains in particular is implicated (Ebersbach et al. 2017).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Despite being quite a small family, Saxifragaceae have about 100 species  (largely <i>Saxifraga</i>) that are cushion plants adapted to cold and dry environments, often growing at higher altitudes (Boucher et al. 2016b; Ebersbach et al. 2017). Indeed, the only other family with a comparable  number of cushion species, Caryophyllaceae, has three times as many species overall.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> The polyphyletic <i>Mitella</i>, along with a few other Saxifragaceae, is very largely pollinated by fungus gnats, and this association has evolved in parallel. Flowers of these species are often more or less broadly saucer-shaped and the petals have very narrow lobes (Okuyama et al. 2008). Cryptic species are being discovered in the fungus gnat-pollinated <i>Mitella</i> sect. <i>Asimitellaria</i> (Okuyama &amp; Kato 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The moth <i>Greya</i> (Prodoxidae, a rather basal glossatan lepidopteran), related to <i>Tegeticula</i> of yucca moth fame (see Asparagales-<a href="asparagalesweb.htm#Agavaceae" target="home">Agavoidoideae</a>), is both a seed predator and pollinator of some Saxifragaceae (Segraves &amp; Thompson 1999); this association is being studied in considerable detail, clarifying the diversification of both plant and pollinating seed parasite (Rich et al. 2008 and references). Other insects also pollinate the flowers, and their number varies from year to year (Pellmyr &amp; Thompson 1996). There is great - and unusual, at least in taxa with comparable floral biologies - variation in floral scent in <i>Lithophragma</i>, one of the saxifragaceous genera involved (Friberg et al. 2013). It has been suggested that the general lability of ovary position in the family (e.g. Klopfer 1972b) is connected to selection by such pollinators (Soltis &amp; Hufford 2002); protected, i.e. inferior, ovaries will be favoured.  See Ranunculaceae, Moraceae, Phyllanthaceae, Caryophyllaceae and Asparagaceae-Agavoideae for similar seed eater/pollination interactions, and Hembry and Althoff (2016)  for a review of diversification and coevolution in them.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The seeds of a number of forest-dwelling Saxifragaceae are dispersed by rain, whether by a splash-cup mechanism, as in <i>Mitella</i> or <i>Chrysosplenium</i>, or ballistically by the seeds being thrown from the fruit as it moves violently after being hit by a drop of water, as in <i>Heuchera</i>.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Short-cycle <i>Puccinia</i>
rusts (Uredinales, basidiomycetes) are frequently found on Saxifragaceae (Savile 1979a, b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Introgressive
hybridisation in the <i>Heuchera</i> clade is extensive and there are various combinations of chloroplast
and nuclear genomes. For example, the chloroplast genome of <i>Mitella</i> is found in some species of <i>Heuchera</i> (Folk et al. 2016) and that of <i>Tellima</i> is found in <i>Mitella</i>, and parents of the two genomes involved may now inhabit different continents
(e.g. D. Soltis et al. 1993; Okuyama et al. 2013). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In <i>Saxifraga</i> s. str.
the diploid chromosome number varies from 12-ca 200, in <i>Micranthes</i> from 10-120.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The distribution of druses and acicular crystals is of systematic interest (Gornall 1987); only <i>Saxifraga</i> s.l. has been studied in detail. Over 50 vascular bundles may enter
the petiole base in some taxa. Hydathodes are common.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Saxena (1973) suggested that the androecium of Saxifragaceae was not obdiplostemonous; from Gelius's (1967) description of androecial development, the relationship between the whorls can change during development. The stylar vascular supply is from dorsal and ventral carpellar bundles; the vascularization of the nectary is variable (Saxena 1973). In at least some species of <i>Saxifraga</i>,
and in <i>Astilbe</i> and <i>Rodgersia</i>, the two carpels are oblique, but in
the latter two this is associated with inverted floral orientation, the odd K
being abaxial; many other taxa have
superposed carpels (Eichler 1878; Engler 1930a;
Eckert 1966). Variation in ovary position within the family is extreme, occurring within genera and even between the different morphs of heterostylous flowers (e.g. Kuzoff et al. 2001; Soltis &amp; Hufford 2002). In <i>Chrysosplenium</i> one carpel is open, the other closed. There is great variation in endosperm development, some taxa apparently having helobial endosperm (Mauritzon 1933).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general
information, see Morf (1950) and Spongberg (1972); McGregor (2008) provides a well-illustrated summary of the ornamentally important <i>Micranthes</i> and <i>Saxifraga</i>. Some details of vegetative anatomy are taken from Thouvenin (1890) and Gornall (1998), of venation from Z. Zhang et al. (2015b: focus on <i>Saxifraga</i>), of floral anatomy from Bensel and Palser (1975b), of floral morphology from Klopfer (e.g. 1968, 1970a, b, 1973), Klopfer and Ziesing (1971) and Ronse Decraene et al. (1998c: <i>Chrysosplenium</i>), of pollen from Z. Zhang et al. (2015a: mostly <i>Saxifraga</i>), of embryology from Pace (1912), Mauritzon (1933: much detail), Vignon-F&eacute;tr&eacute; (1968) and Gornall (1989),  and of seed morphology from Kaplan (1981: also pollen, etc., <i>Saxifraga</i> s.l.) and Knapp (1998). Given the history of the circumscription of Saxifragaceae, early references to it may contain information about several other families, too.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> There are two major clades in Saxifragaceae. One includes <i>Saxifraga</i> s. str., largely arctic-alpine in distribution; for relationships, see Gao et al. (2015), Tkach et al. (2015b) and Ebersbach et al. (2017). Sections [<i>Irregulares</i> - it may have scapose inflorescences (Tkach et al. 2015b) + <i>Heterisia</i>] are sister to the rest of <i>Saxifraga</i>. Heucheroideae include the rest; <i>Micranthes</i>, which used to be part of <i>Saxifraga</i>, is well embedded in this clade and is not at all close to <i>Saxifraga</i>. The inflorescence of <i>Saxifraga</i> s. str. often has
cauline bracts, however, that of <i>Darmera</i> is scapose, and there are pollen and testa surface differences between the two.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Most of the morphological variation in the family is in the predominantly temperate Heucheroideae (Soltis et al. 2001; Xiang et al. 2012; Prieto et al. 2013). Relationships in Heucheroideae are quite well resolved, with a topology of [<i>Astilbe</i> et al. [<i>Heuchera</i> et al. [<i>Darmera</i> et al. [<i>Chrysosplenium</i> et al. + <i>Micranthes</i>]]]] (Deng et al. 2014: Bayesian p.ps all 1.0 or close).  Relationships in Tkach et al. (2015b) were somewhat different in detail, although these were not the focus of that paper, in particular,  <i>Cascadia</i> and <i>Saxifragodes</i>, separately or together, were on long branches somewhere near the base of Heucheroideae. For relationships within <i>Darmera</i>, see Tkach et al. (2015a: quite well resolved), and in the <i>Heuchera</i> area, see Folk and Freudenstein (2014); <i>Mitella</i> (see also Okuyama 2016) is polyphyletic. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Generic limits in the <i>Heuchera</i> clade are unclear (Soltis et al. 1996 and refs.; Okuyama et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> In the past, genera "intermediate"
between what was thought to be a very variable Saxifragaceae and other families tended to be included in Saxifragaceae. It hs long been recognized that this was because the inclusion of more odd genera in Saxifragaceae would have
little effect on the family description since there was already so much variation included in it (Pace 1912). However, if placed in the more homogeneous Crassulaceae, for example,
such genera would greatly affect the description of that family and hence make it less
discrete (e.g. <i>Penthorum</i>). Many
tenuinucellate and unitegmic genera that used to be included in Saxifragaceae or Grossulariaceae have turned out to be entirely unrelated to each other. There was clearly a division between Saxifragaceae s. str. + Grossulariaceae s. str., with petals that remain very small for quite some time during development, and Hydrangeaceae (also classically placed in this area), with their relatively faster-developing petals, as is common in the asterids (Gelius 1967), and that flags a major separation. Of Saxifragaceae in the old sense, <i>Parnassia</i> is in
Celastraceae-Celastrales (a conclusion in agreement with data from floral anatomy - e.g. Bensel &amp; Palser 1975a, d), Francoaceae are in Geraniales, <i>Vahlia</i> is unplaced in the lamiids, but is perhaps to be included in Solanales, and so on. However, the
unitegmic <i>Darmera</i> is properly to be
retained in Saxifragaceae (e.g. Gornall 1989).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> An age of (117-)100.2(-76) m.y. was suggested for the clade [Cynomoriaceae [Paeoniaceae + Altingiaceae]] in Naumann et al. (2013).</p>

Weddell (1860) specifically noted that he did not find stomata on foliar organs, and these structures will bear closer examination.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Perfect flowers are also known. There are a number of questions about the floral morphology of <i>Cynomorium</i>, but very few new data have appeared in the last 150 years. The perianth is less well developed in pistillate than in staminate flowers, and there is debate as to its morphological nature - is it perianth, or (partly) bracteate, and if the latter, what is the structure of the inflorescence? The distinctive concave-cristate stylodium lacks vascularization; it may be nectariferous. The pistillode in staminate flowers may be appear to be superior or inferior and the gynoecium in carpellate flowers has been drawn as being semi-superior (Hooker 1856; Li 2008). The style in pistillate flowers is channelled its entire length and has two vascular bundles, a rather odd combination; Hooker (1856) suggested that there are two carpels.  It is unclear whether the ovule has parietal tissue, or whether the cells above the embryo sac represent a nucellar cap; the former is more likely. </p>

or Balanophoranae (e.g. Cronquist 1968; Takhtajan 1997), or their position has seemed to be completely uncertain (see above).</p>
