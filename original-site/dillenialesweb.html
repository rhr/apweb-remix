The five stamens are opposite the petals and there is a well developed nectary, the earliest recorded in the fossil record (Friis et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The positions of possible apomorphies/key innovations around here are particularly unclear. Not only isnformation for all too many critical taxa  incomplete,  there is also uncertainty about relationships in the tree between Ranunculales and Gunnerales and the position of Dilleniales is also unclear.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Tank et al. (2015) suggest that an increase in the net diversification rate associated with the &gamma; genome duplication event (see <a href="gunneralesweb.htm#Guncor" target="home">Gunneridae</a>) could be linked with the [Superosidae + Superasteridae] node; this increase is placed here, pending clarification of the position of Dilleniales.</p>	

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The presence of compitum in rosids and the extended clade including asterids might be key innovations for each (Endress 2011a). Few Dilleniaceae have a compitum and its presence is spotty in eudicot clades. I have placed the character at this node; strictly speaking Dilleniaceae will then have lost a compitum, although if Dilleniaceae turn out to be sister to other Pentapetalae, it could be placed at the node above or, depending on the optimization, at nodes below. Gunneraceae and Sabiaceae, at least, also have a compitum.  Five-merous flowers and the distinction between sepals and petals are other potential key innovations, whatever the position of Dilleniaceae (Endress 2011a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The flowers of Pentapetalae are very distinctive, as indicated by the characterisation above. Five-merous flowers (K5 C5 A10 is a common combination) preponderate (hence the name "pentapetalae"), but they are uncommon in more basal clades (Gonz&aacute;lez &amp; Mello 2009). Compared to many more basal eudicots and monocots, the two perianth whorls are distinctive in that members of each encircle the floral axis, all members of the androecial whorls being adaxial/interior to the petals/inner whorl. Sepals usually have three traces and petals have one, although three-trace petals are sometimes to be found in other eudicots, magnoliids, etc.. There has been much discussion as to the distinction between and evolution of sepals and petals. Petals here may generally be derived from tepals, perhaps ultimately from bracts, not from stamens (perhaps with some exceptions, as in Caryophyllaceae, etc.: Ronse de Craene 2007, 2008). The duplication of a number of genes important in determining the identity of the parts of pentapetalous flowers (<i>AP3</i>, <i>AP1</i>, <i>SEP</i>, <i>AG</i>) may be connected with the &gamma; genome triplication event that is an apomorphy for the core eudicots (Jiao et al. 2012; Vekemans et al. 2012; see P. Soltis &amp; Soltis 2016 for possible key innovation(s)). For monosymmetry and the patterns of <i>CYC</i> gene expression, see Hileman (2014); denser sampling is much needed!</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Taxa that have flowers with many stamens are scattered throughout the core eudicots. The stamens usually develop on common primordia, whether a ring primordium or five or ten separate
primordia, when five, the primordia are often opposite the petals, rather than alternating with them. Numerous individual stamens then develop from these few initial primordia, and development is often centrifugal (secondary or complex polyandry), unlike  magnoliids and the ANA grade, Ranunculales, etc., where the numerous stamens develop acropetally from separate primordia, primary polyandry. At maturity, the stamens of Pentapetalae may be more or less connate
or in fascicles (see Corner 1946b; Weberling 1989; Ronse Decraene &amp; Smets 1992b, 1998c; Leins 2000; Endress 2013 and references; Prenner et al. 2008). Closely related multistaminate taxa can differ in details of androecial development (e.g. Hufford 1990; Ge et al. 2007). Polyandry is decidedly less common in the euasterid clade (see <a href="icacinalesweb.html#euasterids" target="home">discussion</a> there) and it appears to be linked with increases of numbers of petals and/or carpels, just one of the ways in which polyandry occurs here (Ronse De Craene 2016b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Tentatively, then, and based entirely on gross morphology, there seem to have been major changes in floral organisation at the angiosperm node, the monocot node, the commelinid node, the  Pentapetalae node, the asterid node, and perhaps the euasterid node. As noted above, the floral morphology of extant Gunnerales is very different from that of Pentapetalae and is more similar to that of the eudicots immediately basal to them. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the floral development of <i>Berberidopsis corallina</i> and <i>Aextoxicon</i> (Berberidopsidales), possible "links" in the evolution of the flower of core eudicots, see Ronse De Craene (2004, 2007, 2010). The link is at best thought of as an analogy, since several elements of this floral morphology are probably parallelisms within core eudicots and others may even be reversals; there is also considerable variation in floral morphology in this small clade. Berberidospidales are part of the pectination immediately basal to asterids, relationships perhaps being [Berberidopsidales [Santalales [Caryophyllales + Asterids]]] (see below). Chase (2005) noted that in Santalales some floral parts, particularly stamens, might have several whorls, and this perhaps suggested that canalisation of floral development there was less than in some other core eudicots; whether Santalales really are different in this respect from other core eudicot groups remains to be established. Clarification of the phylogenetic position of Dilleniales, etc. (see below), will undoubtedly help in our understanding of floral evolution.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The distribution of ellagic acid is similar to that of common primordium-type polyandry in the eudicots. Sampling of variation in the root apical meristem is poor, and possible reversals (for which, see Groot et al. 2004) have not been placed on the tree.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Lee et al. (2004) suggest that the <i>CRABS CLAW</i> gene is expressed in core eudicot nectaries (including extrafloral nectaries), or at least in the rosids and asterids that they sampled; it was not expressed in nectaries of Ranunculaceae; what happens in Proteaceae, which has axial nectaries, like rosids (e.g. Smets 1988) and Sabiaceae is unfortunately unknown. This gene is not expressed in the extrafloral nectaries of Passifloraceae (Krosnick et al. 2008a).  Sucrose synthesis and secretion is similar in the nectaries of Brassicaceae and Solanaceae, extrastaminal and gynoecial nectaries respectively (Lin et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> This clade is strongly supported, e.g. Chase et al. (1993), D. Soltis et al. (1997, 1999, 2003a), Hoot et al. (1998), and Nandi
et al. (1998), and just about all subsequent studies; support is rather weaker in Zhu et al. (2007). Within this large clade, although the rosid and asterid clades are well supported, other relationships were initially unclear, and they were shown as a hexatomy in the sixth and earlier versions of this site that involved Crossosomatales, Berberidopsidales, Caryophyllales, Santalales, rosids and asterids; Dilleniales and Saxifragales were also of uncertain positions.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">However, D. Soltis et al. (2003a: four-gene analysis, only 54% jacknife support) suggested that Berberidopsidales were sister to the rest of the non-rosid core eudicots. Santalales were associated with asterids, while Saxifragales and Vitales linked with [Dilleniales + Caryophyllales], but with still less support (D. Soltis et al. 2003a). In some studies Dilleniaceae were sister to Caryophyllales, but with only very moderate support; D. Soltis et al. (2003a) provided rather stronger (83% jacknife) support for this position (see also Soltis et al. 2007a: 1.0 p.p.). It also seemed possible that [Caryophyllales + Dilleniales] and Santalales formed a clade (D. Soltis et al. 2000); Carlquist (2006) suggested that non-bordered perforation plates was a possible similarity between Santalales and Caryophyllales. Caryophyllales were linked with
with asterids in a large 18S ribosomal DNA analysis (Soltis et al. 1997), albeit
with only weak support (see also Hilu et al. 2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In studies using whole chloroplast genomes (Jansen et al. 2006a, esp. 2006b; Hansen et al. 2007; Cai et al. 2007; Ruhlman et al. 2006; Jansen et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2007; Logacheva et al. 2008) support for a [Caryophyllales + asterids] clade was stronger, however, Berberidospidales, Dilleniales, Santalales and Saxifragales were not included. [Caryophyllales + Santalales] were sister to asterids in some analyses in a study that focused on the position of Cynomoriaceae and Balanophoraceae (Nickrent et al. 2005: again, see sampling). In a study using the mitochondrial gene <i>mat</i>R,  Caryophyllales repeated as sister to asterids, but with very little support; in other analyses including a reduced sampling and two chloroplast genes Santalales and Dilleniales were also in this area, but again with little support (Zhu et al. 2007). In the combined morphological and molecular study of Nandi et al. (1998) the position of Caryophyllales was uncertain, but
this was perhaps partly because the ovules of Rhabdodendraceae, there sister to all other Caryophyllales, were interpreted
as being unitegmic; however, subsequent work suggested that Rhabdodendraceae are not sister to all other Caryophyllales, but rather to core Caryophyllales and immediately associated families (see <a href="caryophyllalesweb.htm#Caryophyllales" target="home">Caryophyllales</a>). For more discussion on the relationships of Saxifragales and Vitales, see the <a href="saxifragalesweb.htm#Saxvitros" target="home">former</a> in particular. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In any event, it was becoming increasingly likely that Caryophyllales, whether or not accompanied by a number of other taxa, were sister to asterids (but c.f. Goloboff et al. 2009). There was support for placing Crossosomatales as sister to the core malvid group (Huerteales, Sapindales, etc.: e.g. Zhu et al. 2007; Soltis et al. 2011; Magall&oacute;n et al. 2015; M. Sun et al. 2016: support weak).  In a two-gene study focussing of early-diverging eudicots, Dilleniales, Berberidopsidales, Santalales and Caryophyllales grouped in a pectinate fashion with the asterids, although support was low (Hilu et al. 2008). Wang et al. (2009: 12-gene plus plastid inverted repeat) in a study of the rosids found that Berberidopsidales was sister to a clade made up of the few Caryophyllales and asterids they had included.  Moore et al. (2008) in a preliminary analysis of whole-chloroplast genome data, suggested that most members of the basal polytomy of the core eudicots could be placed as a series of pectinate branches immediately basal to the asterids; Moore et al. (2010) suggested the relationships [Santalales [Berberidopsidales [Caryophyllales + Asterids]]], the position of Caryophyllales having the least support, while in Moore et al. (2011) the position of the middle two orders was inverted (see also Arakaki et al. 2011; Ruhfel et al. 2014; Zeng et al. 2014: suppl. Fig. 14; Magall&oacute;n et al. 2015: [Berb. + Cary.], Dilleniales sister to all these). Relationships in Bell et al. (2010) were [Berberidopsidales [Caryophyllales, Santalales, asterids]], and in Soltis et al. (2011: little bootstrap support) they were [Santalales [[Berberidopsidales + Caryophyllales] + asterids]], i.e. their superasteridae. The transcriptome analyses of  Wickett et al. (2014) also placed Caryophyllales in this area. All this is consistent with many of the earlier, more tentatively suggested relationships. However, a recent concatenated analysis of 110 single-copy protein sequences suggested that <i>Beta vulgaris</i> (Caryophyllales) was sister to a [rosid + asterid] clade  (Dohm et al. 2013), but there may be methodological (see Xi et al. 2013b) and sampling issues here. Moreover, mitochondrial and nuclear genes placed Caryophyllales <u>within</u> rosids s.l., although support for this position was underwhelming (Sun et al. 2014).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some morphological evidence, including seed coat anatomy, might suggest a specific relationship between Dilleniales and <a href="vitalesweb.html#Vitros" target="home">Vitales</a>. Horne (2006) listed a number of features linking Dilleniaceae and Rhabdodendraceae, then thought to be sister to all other Caryophyllales, some of which could be features of [Dilleniales + Caryophyllales], and the status of the others depended on an improved resolution of relationships. These features include absence of tension wood; successive cambia present; vessel elements with simple perforation plates; wood with SiO<sub>2</sub> bodies; nodes 3 or more:3 or more; leaves spiral; K persistent in fruit. However, Rhabdodendraceae are now placed sister to the core Caryophyllales and immediately associated families (e.g. Drysdale et al. 2007; Brockington et al. 2007, 2015), so the significance of these similarities is unclear. </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The position of Dilleniales is still uncertain. Bell et al. (2010) placed them sister to Caryophyllales and Soltis et al. (2011) in a broadly similar position as sister to their superasteridae, and with 87% ML bootstrap support; this position was also found by Arakaki et al. (2011), who included a larger sample of caryophyllalean chloroplast genomes. Similarly Qiu et al. (2010) found a weakly supported [Dilleniales + Berberidopsidales] clade sister to an [asterid [Santalales + Caryophyllales]] clade, but also with very weak support. Moore et al. (2008), Sun et al. (2013: crown-group age 116-112 m.y.o.) and Ruhfel et al. (2014: not amino acid analyses - sister to asterids) suggested that Dilleniales were sister to rosids, although support could be stronger, while  Moore et al. (2011) found a weakly supported [Dilleniales [rosids s.l./superrosids + asterids s.l./superasterids]] clade (see also Z.-D. Chen et al. (016). In an analysis of 18S/26S nuclear ribosomal data the clades [Dilleniales + Celastrales] and [Caryophyllales + Zygophyllales] were recovered, both embedded in the rosids but with vanishingly little support, while there was some support for the position of Santalales as sister to all other Pentapetalae, and little support for Berberidopsidales as sister to the remaining Pentapetalae (Maia et al. 2014). Finally, Zeng et al. (2014) found <i>Dillenia</i> to be somewhere at the base of Pentapetalae (although sometimes sister to <i>Gunnera</i>), and there were the two major pentapetalous clades as recognized here. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Recent work using relatively massive amounts of data but relatively few taxa has suggested a rather different set of relationships - [[Santalales [Vitales [Saxifragales + rosids]]] [[Dilleniales + Caryophyllales] Asterids]] with Berberidopsidales of uncertain position and sister to either of the two main clades depending on the analysis (Zeng et al. 2017). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Conclusion: Dilleniaceae are near basal somewhere in Pentapetalae, but that is about all that can be said, so they are best left unplaced.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> In Versions 8 and earlier of this site this was called the the core eudicot clade, largely because the evolution of the "typical" core eudicot flower can be pegged to this node; the current delimitation of core eudicots  refers to a clade that is molecularly well supported but that is perhaps morphologically less interesting. </p>

These often have vessels with simple perforation plates, and a correlation between the liane habit and simple vessels has been noted here and elsewhere (Carlquist 1991b; Isnard &amp; Feild 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Buzz pollination by bees is common in Dilleniaceae, although some species of <i>Hibbertia</i>, for example, have anthers dehiscing longitudinally (Endress 1997b; Tucker &amp; Berhardt 2000; Horn 2007 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The dispersal unit is generally the arillate seed, which is endozoochorous, eaten by birds or monkeys (e.g. <i>Dillenia</i>), or myrmecochorous, as in <i>Hibbertia</i> in particular (Lengyel et al. 2009, 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Caterpillars of the tortricid Phricanthini moths are known only from Dilleniaceae (Powell et al. 1999). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> There are often sclereids in the pith. <i>Hibbertia</i> is very variable vegetatively. Species of <i>Hibbertia</i> sect. <i>Pachynema</i>have very much reduced leaves and winged, photosynthetic stems; they are souped-up inflorescences. Rury and Dickison (1977) describe the diversity of leaf venation patterns in the genus.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Hibbertia</i> is very variable florally. The monosymmetric flowers of <i>Didesmandra aspera</i> have two bundles of stamens on the functionally upper side of the flower, in each there is a single fertile stamen longer than the rest; the flower is drawn as if the plane of symmetry in horizontal (Stapf 1900); the monosymmetric flowers of <i>Schumacheria</i> have only a single staminal bundle in which all stamens are about the same lengths. The androecium is supplied by a whorl of stamen trunks which branch irregulary to supply the individual stamens, and when the androecium is fasciculate, stamens of a single fascicle may be supplied by more than one stamen trunk (Wilson 1965, 1974c).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">See Kubitzki (1971), Horn (2006, 2009) and Dickison (1971b and references) for general information, Dickison (1969) for nodal anatomy, which is variable, Dickison et al. (1978) for vascular anatomy in <i>Hibbertia</i>, Paetow (1931), Sastri (1958a), Swamy and Periasamy (1955), Endress (1997b) and Tucker and Bernhardt (2000) for floral morphology, embryology, etc.,  and Dickison et al. (1982) for pollen morphology.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For the relationships above, well supported, I follow Horn (2002, 2009); <i>Hibbertia</i> is paraphyletic, <i>Pachynema</i> being embedded in it, while the status of <i>Acrotrema</i> (Dillenioideae) is unclear. </p>
