<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  Imperfect flowers pervade the two orders. However, flower type varies considerably in Anisophylleaceae, with perfect flowers occurring in <i>Combretocarpus</i>, as well as in fossils placed in  href="../orders/fagalesweb.htm#Fagales">Fagales</a>) and in a few extant members of that order, so there may have been reversals of this character, or imperfect flowers have evolved more than once (see also the clade below). "Embryo with large cotyledons" may be another synapomorphy (L.-B. Zhang et al. 2006), also a three-carpellate gynoecium. However, ovary position and fruit characters in particular reverse spectacularly in this clade (see also Matthews &amp; Endress 2004; Zhang et al. 2006), although Endress (2011a) thought that an inferior ovary might be a key innovation somewhere around here. The character "fruit indehiscent" could be placed at the [Rosales [Cucurbitales + Fagales]] node. See also Taylor et al. (2012) for additional possible apomorphies. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Note:</b>  <b>Boldface</b> denotes possible apomorphies, (....) denotes a feature common in the clade, exact status uncertain, [....] includes explanatory material. Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> It is unclear where some of the features suggested by Filipowicz and Renner (2010) as being apomorphies of the order should be placed on the tree. Some, such as inferior ovary, are likely to characterize the [Cucurbitales + Fagales] clade, others, such as breeding system, are very labile and are perhaps more likely to characterize a clade within Cucurbitales. L.-B. Zhang et al. (2006) also discuss aspects of morphological evolution and evaluate the extensive variation in breeding system in the clade.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> For nitrogen fixation by <i>Frankia</i>, see <a href="fabalesweb.htm#Fabsecphys" target="home">elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Zhang and Renner (2003) suggested that the flowers are usually imperfect, but perfect flowers are known from Anisophylleaceae. Indeed, breeding systems vary considerably in Cucurbitales. Schaefer and Renner (2010) suggested that even within <i>Momordica</i> (Cucurbitaceae) there have been perhaps seven reversals from dioecy to monoecy - in a clade that is very approximately 35 m.y. old, while Bertin and Newman (1993) and Routley et al. (2004) note various kinds of dichogamy in the order.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Butterfly caterpillars appear to be relatively uncommon on members of the order.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Cuticle waxes are usually not well developed. Possession of libriform fibres and slightly oblique end walls of vessel elements may be synapomorphies (Wagstaff &amp; Dawson 2000, see also data in Nandi et al. 1998), as may banded wood parenchyma (Baas et al. 2000), homogeneous rays, and the possession of bitter compounds. Stipules are not placed as a synapomorphy of the order, although the data presented by Matthews and Endress (2004) might suggest that this was an option. However, not only does the morphology of the stipules in Anisophylleaceae and Corynocarpaceae need clarification, but the presence of stipules may be a synapomorphy at a much higher level (see rosids et al. above). Polarity of the character of leaf venation is unclear, since <i>Combretocarpus</i> is sister to other Anisophylleaceae and Corynocarpaceae are sister to Coriariaceae; the first member of both pairs has pinnate venation, and the two clades are successively basal to the rest of the order.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">More or less lacinate petals (and staminodes) are common in the order (Endress &amp; Matthews 2006b). The thickness of the outer integument varies considerably. Matthews and Endress (2004, summarized in 2006b) provide an excellent survey of floral morphology of the group. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For the
circumscription of the clade see e.g. Setoguchi et al. (1999) and Schwarzbach and Ricklefs (2000); there is now general agreement as to what it contains. Coriariaceae and
Corynocarpaceae are consistently recognized as sister taxa, and their very similar wood anatomy is consistent with such a position (Carlquist &amp; Miller 2001). However, other relationships remained poorly understood (Brouillet 2001 for some comments), and although L.-B. Zhang and Renner (2003a), using a variety of both chloroplast and nuclear genes, suggested that Anisophylleaceae were sister to the rest of Cucurbitales, H.-L. Li et al. (2015) found the clade  [Anisophylleaceae + Cucurbitaceae], but its position had little support (c.f. H.-L. Li et al. 2016). Zhang et al. (2006) in a nine-gene study (all three compartments) confirmed these relationships and also placed Cucurbitaceae as sister to a [Tetramelaceae + Datiscaceae + Begoniaceae] clade, although relationships within this latter group were still not entirely clear. The clade [Datiscaceae + Begoniaceae] had at best only moderate support (Zhang et al. 2006; see also Schaefer et al. 2009; Schaefer &amp; Renner 2011b), but this topology is followed here - c.f. Soltis et al. (2007a) and Bell et al. (2010).  For possible
relationships between Tetramelaceae and Datiscaceae, see Swensen et al. (1994, 1998) and H.-L. Li et al. (2015: support low); this family pair was also recovered by M. Sun et al. (2016), but  most of the relationships there had little support. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The relationships of the holoparasitic Apodanthaceae were for some time unclear (e.g. they are unplaced in A.P.G. 2009). Nickrent et al. (2004) suggested a place either within Malvales (especially the three-gene analyses and that of nuclear SSU rDNA), or in or near Cucurbitales (analysis of <i>mat</i>R), but inclined to the former position. Barkman et al. (2007: support weak, but rather comprehensive analysis) also suggested the latter position; the mitochondral genes <i>cox</i>1 and <i>mat</i>R showed massive divergence, but not the <i>atp</i>1 gene (Barkman et al. 2007). Additional  molecular analyses (D. Nickrent, pers. comm.; esp. Filipowicz &amp; Renner 2010) support the position of Apodanthaceae in Cucurbitales. This is consistent with their dioecy, extrose anthers, inferior ovary and parietal placentation, all features common in Cucurbitales (see also Filipowicz &amp; Renner 2010), but all these features are generally common in parasitic plants (Renner &amp; Ricklefs 1995). There are also a number of codon subsitutions in common between Apodanthaceae and Cucurbitales (Barkman et al. 2007;  Filipowicz &amp; Renner 2010). The exact position of the family in Cucurbitales remains unclear, the relationships suggested with the morphologically rather different (but apomorphically so) Corynocarpaceae and Coriariaceae being only weakly supported, and Apodanthaceae are on a very long branch (Filipowicz &amp; Renner 2010; see also M. Sun et al. 2016). The situation remained the same in Bellot and Renner (2014b), and in trees used when estimating substitiution rates Apodanthaceae linked either with a clade [Anisophylleaceae + Corynocarpaceae] or a clade including the whole of the rest of the family, but with a rather different topology to that used here; other topologies were also obtained, although none with strong support.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Cucurbitales are another rather unexpected assemblage of families. Coriariaceae have often been placed with families that have separate carpels and so were thought to be "primitive". Rhizophoraceae and Anisophylleaceae were often associated in the twentieth century, e.g. being placed in separate but adjacent orders, as in Takhtajan (1997), or even in the same family. However, although both were placed in Rosidae by Cronquist (1981), they were not adjacent. Indeed, morphological differences between the two are marked (e.g. Juncosa and Tomlinson 1988; Tomlinson 1988), and Rhizophoraceae are now securely placed in Malpighiales where they are sister to Erythroxylaceae; the two have much in common. Apodanthaceae have often been included in Rafflesiaceae s.l.. Cucurbitaceae, Begoniaceae and Tetramelaceae were placed adjacent in a group of families with parietal placentation in Cronquist (1981), but that group has since been fragmented.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Similarities in floral morphology between <i>Anisophyllea</i> and <i>Ceratopetalum</i> (Oxalidales-Cunoniaceae: see Matthews et al. 2001; Endress &amp; Matthews 2006b), although striking, are unlikely to be evidence of immediate close relationships of the two. The fossil <i>Platydiscus peltatus</i> seems to suggest similar relationships (Sch&ouml;nenberger et al. 2001a; see also Sch&ouml;nenberger &amp; von Balthazar 2006), and it was included in a study of Oxalidales by Heibl and Renner (2012). </p>

<ul><li>Anisophylleaceae are a rather undistinguished-looking family. The leaves are often rather coriaceous, yellowish drying, entire, and more or less asymmetric at the base, and sometimes anisophyllous.  The flowers are small and the ovary is inferior.</ul>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Vincent and Tomlinson (1983) discussed the distinctive vegetative architecture of <i>Anisophyllea</i>, while Dengler et al. (1989) looked at the primary vascular organization of the orthotropic and plagiotropic shoots - quite different.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The staminate flowers of <i>Anisophyllea disticha</i> appear to have a semi-superior ovary with central styluli while the carpellate flowers have an inferior ovary, there is a roof on the ovary and the styluli are submarginal (Ruth Crevel, in Ding Hou 1858). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> <i>Combretocarpus</i> was found to be sister to the rest of the family (L.-B. Zhang et al. 2007), somewhat in conflict with morphology-based relationships (e.g. Tobe &amp; Raven 1987c, 1988c); this may have an important effect on the polarity of characters in the family or even the order as a whole. However, M. Sun et al. (2016) recovered the groupings [[<i>Combretocarpus</i> + <i>Polygonanthus</i>] [<i>Poga</i> + <i>Anisophyllea</i>]] so everything is a little confused.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Anisophylleaceae were often linked with or included in Rhizophoraceae (Malpighiales: see above). However, the inner integument is ca 2 cell layers thick, there are no laticifers, the petals are not aristate, and a sclerified exotegmen is absent; in these and many other characters Anisophylleaceae differ from Rhizophoraceae (see Juncosa &amp; Tomlinson 1988a, b).</p>

<ul><li>Corynocarpaceae are best recognised by dissecting their flowers. These are quite distinctive, although small: The stamens are opposite the petals and alternate with fringed staminodes, and the ovary usually has but a single style. Vegetatively the family is rather less distinctive, having spirally-arranged leaves with intrapetiolar stipules (not exactly prominent!), and the lamina has entire margins.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The cork develops from the cell layer beneath the epidermis.</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">It is perhaps unclear whether the gynoecium is pseudomonomerous or unicarpellate. However, since some flowers have two styluli (e.g. Matthews &amp; Endress 2004), the single, excentrically-placed structure at the apex of the gynoecium is called a stylulus and the gynoecium is pseudomonomerous {sic]. Tobe et al. (1992a) noted that fibres developing from the  inner part of the mesocarp ran longitudinally in the fruit while those developed from the endocarp (the cells divided) ran circumferentially. The pulp is bitter, and the seeds are very poisonous, containing alkaloids. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Molecular estimates of the age of crown-group Coriariaceae are around 69-63 m.y. (Yokoyama et al. 2000).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fossils of <i>Coriaria</i> are known from about 33 m.y.o. deposits in France (de Saporta 1865: pp. 211-217, pl. 12:1).</p>

<ul><li>Coriariaceae can be recognised by their opposite, sessile, entire leaves with veins coming from the base and at most minute stipules; many branches look like compound leaves, apparently being of limited growth. The inflorescences are racemes and the flowers have a poorly differentiated, biseriate perianth and carpels that are connate at most only basally; the fruits are achenes that are surrounded by the accrescent corolla and have long, subbasal styles that remain attached.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Biogeographic relationships within the family can be summarized as [Eurasia [[S. and W. Pacific + Central and N. South America]] (Yokoyama et al. 2000).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Although the carpels seem to be separate, a compitum appears to be developed (Gu&eacute;d&egrave;s 1971; Matthews &amp; Endress 2004). There is but a single seed per carpel, but several seeds are produced by each flower. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous relationships.</b> Coriariaceae were placed in Ranunculales by Cronquist (1981) and as a monotypic Coriariales in Rosidae (Takhtajan 1997), largely because of their apparently separate carpels.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> An apomorphy for this clade may be "plant dioecious" (L.-B. Zhang et al. 2006; K&auml;fer et al. 2012) even if most members of the clade are monoecious, and in Cucurbitaceae in particular flower type is very labile (K&auml;fer et al. 2017 for literature).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For information on leaf teeth, see Hickey and Wolfe (1975). The development of a roof over the ovary formed from tissue adaxial to the stylulus (Matthews &amp; Endress 2004) is obvious when well developed; the styluli are then widely separate and borne towards the margin of the ovary. Matthews and Endress (2006) note details of ovule morphology that this group has in common.</p>

<ul><li>Cucurbitaceae are easily recognised. They are vines or lianes with often rather roughly hairy exstipulate leaves that have palmate venation. In the leaf axil there is a usually lateral and branched tendril, a vegetative bud, a flower, or a yet more complex organisation. The plants are dioecious or monoecious, and the flowers have a hypanthium or joint calyx/corolla tube, an often complex androecium made up of twisted, monothecal anthers borne in the centre of the flower, and an inferior ovary with parietal placentation. The corolla is often more or less yellow, sometimes red. The seeds are more or less flattened.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For numerous dates within the family, see Schaefer et al. (2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The current world-wide range of Cucurbitaceae is in large part the result of extensive dispersal, Madagascar being colonized an estimated thirteen times and Australia twelve times - and the latter currently has only twelve genera and thirty species of Cucurbitaceae (Schaefer et al. 2009). The secondarily woody Socotran endemic <i>Dendrosicyos</i> is dated to (30-)22(-14) m.y., although Socotra itself is only about ten m.y. old, which suggests that the clade now represented by just the single species was once on the mainland and has since become extinct there (Schaefer et al. 2009, but c.f. Renner &amp; Schaefer 2016). Sebastian et al. (2012) suggested that there had been four westwards trans-Pacific dispersal events in the New World <i>Sicyos</i> alone, while de Boer et al. (2014) also dated extensive dispersal in <i>Trichosanthes</i>. For more on dispersal in the family, see Duchen and Renner (2010).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Most Cucurbitaceae are climbing plants, whether lianes or vines, and are a particularly prominent component of this vegetation element in the New World (Gentry 1991). They climb by tendrils, whether branched or simple, and  the spirals at the ends of the tendril (branches) are opposing, reversal occurring at what is called a perversion, the result being a very springy structure which dissipates strain on the system (Gerbode et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The phloem system in Cucurbitaceae is very complex.  Fischer (1884) early noted that not all Cucurbitaceae had bicollateral vascular bundles (they are an apomorphy of only part of the family - see above). Taxa that do have bicollateral vascular bundles also have extrafascicular phloem (EFP) strands in the cortex outside the sclerenchymatous ring, although their development there is weak in taxa like <i>Thladiantha</i> and <i>Momordica</i> (Fischer 1884). EFP strands link with the adaxial phloem cells of the vascular bundles (Schmitz et al. 1987), but only at the nodes (Fischer 1883); in taxa like <i>Cucurbita</i> EFP strands permeate the cortex, even occuring in the collenchyma, and commissural strands are common (Fischer 1884). The sieve tubes of the EFP system differ in morphology from those of the fascicular phloem, although they may be similar to cells in the peripheral part of the latter (Crafts  1932). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">When the plant is damaged, the copious phloem exudate comes largely from EFP, flow from the bundle phloem being blocked by callose almost immediately. The composition of EFP and fascicular phloem exudate is very different: Fascicular phloem exudate is rich in sugars and unidentified proteins, etc., EFP exudate contains P-proteins, amino acids, protein synthesizing machinery, and various secondary metabolites, but little sugar (L.-B. Zhang et al. 2010).  Zhang et al. (2012) found that phloem exudate came from different parts of the system in different species, although the completely extrafascicular sieve tubes were not involved. Not much of the exudate was from the fascicular phloem itself, and they thought that one of the functions of the P-protein in EFP exudate might even be to block the flow of water from the cut xylem as it congealed, although initially the water helped make large droplets of noxious (the exudate contains cucurbitacins - see below) and sticky exudate (Gaupels &amp; Ghirado 2013). There is substantial evidence (Gaupels et al. 2012; see also Turgeon &amp; Oparka 2010) that the EFP system is involved more in plant defence, and Gaupels et al. (2012) even thought that ecologically EFP exudate was like latex (see also Tallamy 1985; Konno 2011; Gaupels &amp; Ghirado 2013). Interestingly, aphids feed on the abaxial phloem, and autoradiograms of minor veins suggest that abaxial phloem cells here are the sole conduits for carbon export and import, indeed, in the very finest veins there is no adaxial phloem system at all, i.e. the bundles there are collateral (Botha &amp; Evert 1978; Schmitz et al. 1987; Hebeler 2000 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">More needs to be done to understand the complex vascular anatomy of the family, especially in the basal clades, to work out further details of how EFP is involved in plant defence, and how it links with the adaxial intrafascicular system. Much of the earlier work on phloem and phloem transport in Cucurbitaceae - because of the copious exudate, this had seemed to be an ideal system and has been much studied - actually has been carried out on EFP (Zhang et al. 2010)! </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> There are a number of interesting pollinator-plant interactions in the family. In general, carpellate flowers produce no nectar and the  style with its branching stigmas allows them to mimic nectar-producing staminate flowers (Renner &amp; Schaefer 2016). <i>Heliconius</i> butterflies, whose caterpillars eat <i>Passiflora</i> vines (see Passifloraceae), are also closely associated with <i>Psiguria</i> (Cucurbitaceae), which they pollinate while at the same time obtaining nutrients from the pollen, probably by enzymatic activity of the saliva; the butterflies also visit some species of the closely related <i>Gurania</i> (e.g. Gilbert 1972, 1975; Boggs et al. 1981; Spencer 1988; Eberhard et al. 2009: see Steele 2010 for a summary and Steele et al. 2010 for a phylogeny of <i>Psiguria</i>). Interestingly, both <i>Psiguria</i> and <i>Gurania</i> have pollen grains in tetrads, alone in the family (Steele 2010). <i>Psiguria</i> in particular has very long-lived staminate inflorescences, and flowers are produced continuously for months or more. Other Cucurbitaceae, notably <i>Momordica</i> and <i>Thladiantha</i>, are oil flowers, the ca 19 extant species of Ctenoplectrini bees being associated with Cucurbitaceae and collecting material from the oil-secreting hairs, as well as pollen and nectar (Buchmann 1987; Vogel 1981b, 1990, 1998c: variation in nectary morphology and secretion). Ctenoplectrini are an Old World group and are probably sister to the Eucerini; they may have diverged in the early Eocene ca 50 m.y.a. and now probably pollinate over 100 species of the family (Schaefer &amp; Renner 2008b).  Although <i>Ctenoplectra</i> bees visit <i>Momordica</i>, carpellate flowers in some species lack rewards (Schaefer &amp; Renner 2010), deceit pollination? </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Squash and gourd bees, some 20 species of the genera <i>Peponapis</i> and <i>Xenoglossa</i>, pollinate only species of <i>Cucurbita</i>. They feed early in the day, even flying in the dark pre-dawn hours (Hurd et al. 1971). They are attracted by particular floral volatiles, repelled by others which attract the cucumber beetles, while yet others seem to attract both herbivore and pollinator  (Andrews et al. 2007). The bees, restricted to the Americas north of northern Peru, show some species-specific variation in pollen collecting devices (Hurd &amp; Linsley 1964); <i>Cucurbita</i> can clearly be pollinated by a variety of bees since it is cultivated pretty much world wide.  Within <i>Cayaponia</i> there have been shifts from bat to bee pollination, uncommon elsewhere in flowering plants (Duchen &amp; Renner 2010). A number of taxa have elaborately fringed margins of their corolla lobes, while <i>Momordica anigosantha</i> has quite strongly monosymmetric staminate flowers, both in form and especially colour patterning, yet the carpellate flowers are less remarkable (Zimmermann 1922).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Breeding systems in Cucurbitaceae can be very labile, with multiple reversals from dioecy to monoecy likely in <i>Momordica</i> alone (Schaefer &amp; Renner 2010; see also Kocyan et al. 2007; Volz &amp; Renner 2008); determination of the sex of the flower by environmental cues is also known in the family (Renner et al. 2007b). Boualem et al. (2015) discuss the molecular control in the transition from monoecy to dioecy. Bertin and Newman (1993) consider the family to be interflorally protandrous, while Bentley et al. (2004) record it is being  protogynous; the latter are correct.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Myxospermy is reported from a number of Cucurbitoideae (Grubert 1974). Large mammals, relatively unaffected by the bitter cucurbitacins commonly found in the fruits (see below), have been implicated in the dispersal of cucurbitaceous seeds; the megafauna involved is in places (the New World) now extinct (Kistler et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Low concentrations of the very bitter cucurbitacins, tetracyclic sterol-like triterpenes that are among the most bitter substances known to humans, elicit a compulsive feeding response from luperine beetles, including rootworm leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae-Galerucinae-Luperini: see Metcalf et al. 1980; Jolivet &amp; Hawkeswood 1995). Gillespie et al. (2008) outline their phylogeny; there are some 4,000 species. 80% of the host plant records of the group are from Cucurbitaceae, and many species are pharmacophagous. That is, adults visit the flowers, feeding on pollen and sometimes other parts of the plant, and they sequester these bitter cucurbitacins (Eben 1999; Tallamy et al. 2005). The beetles are attracted by volatiles coming both from flowers and other parts of the plant (Andrews et al. 2007). Furtheromore, large mammals are relatively unaffected by cucurbitacins in fruits, while smaller mammals may find these fruits to be toxic, and smaller mammals also have more genes encoding bitter taste receptors  to help avoid such fruits than do larger mammals (Kistler et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The larvae of some galerucines also feed on Cucurbitaceae, and this ability may have evolved independently in Old and New World members, Aulacophorina and Diabroticina respectively (Gillespie et al. 2003). The larvae sometimes cut leaf veins (they "trench" the leaves), so locally interrupting the translocation of cucurbitacins to the leaf tissue and so apparently allowing the insect to eat it (Dussourd &amp; Eisner  1987). However, since at least some of these beetles will eat cucurbitacin crystals neat, physical avoidance of the copious sap produced by Cucurbitaceae is a more likely explanation of this feeding behaviour. Indeed, the concentration of cucurbitacins inside and outside the trench is about the same, but the sap is very rich in P-protein and eventually gels and so would probably thoroughly gum up the mouth parts, etc., of the beetle larvae if they ate untrenched leaves (McCloud et al. 1995; see also below).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The glandular hairs of Cucurbitaceae are another element of the defence of the plant against herbivores, quickly-solidifying secretions being produced when the trichomes are touched by insects (Kellogg et al. 2002). Discharge of sap by these hairs may be explosive, Zimmermann (1922) mentioning what he called "Explosionshaare" in the family.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Larvae of a remarkable number of species of <i>Blepharoneura</i> (Diptera-Tephritidae [fruit flies]) are being discovered in flowers and fruits of neotropical Cucurbitoideae like <i>Gurania</i>. Some species are specific to staminate flowers, others to carpellate; all told some 52 species of flies were found on 24 species of cucurbits (Condon et al. 2008; Steele 2010 for <i>Psiguria</i>). It is estimated that there are around 200 species of <i>Blepharoneura</i>, all likely to be restricted to Cucurbitaceae (Norrbom &amp; Condon) - perhaps the whole subfamily is. 14 species of these flies, on which there were 18 species of parasitoid wasps, were found in one site in Peru; they depended on two species of <i>Gurania</i> (Condon et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Butterfly caterpillars are not often found on members of this family (Ehrlich &amp; Raven 1964).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> The tendrils of Cucurbitaceae are branched, and represent a branch complex (Gerrath et al. 2008; c.f. ). The length of the unbranched part of the tendril varies considerably, and the tendril may be ad- or abaxially curved in bud (Zimmermann 1922). Often there is a sublateral tendril + bud + slightly lateral flower associated with each leaf, or a tendril + vegetative bud + carpellate flower + staminate inflorescence, all more or less collaterally arranged, or other variants. Eichler (1875) and Goebel (1932) suggested that the tendril branches were prophylls, and in <i>Bryonia dioica</i> paired tendrils occur on the pedicel of an axillary flower (see also Kumazawa 1964; Zitnak et al. 2010).  Non-flowering Zanonioideae have tendrils more or less lateral to vegetative axillary buds. When flowering finally begins, tendrils are replaced by more or less axillary flowers. The axillary bud produces an inflorescence branch that has an internode below the prophyllar leaf that subtends the first flower. Most Cucurbitoideae lack an initial prolonged vegetative period, and in one interpretation the inflorescence branch lacks a basal internode, so the first flower, often carpellate, arises in the leaf axil of the main branch and is subtended by a prophyll; the staminate inflorescence represents the development of this prophyllar bud (Lassnig 1997; axillary structures may be collateral in the vegetative part of the plant, sometimes superposed in the reproductive part). However, Gerrath et al. (2008) found that in <i>Echinocystis lobata</i> tendril, axillary bud, carpellate flower, and staminate inflorescence were all more or less independent in origin, although the latter two did arise from a common primordium (see also Zitnak et al. 2010). Joliffieae may be critical in understanding the evolution of the branch-tendril complex. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> In <i>Cucumis</i>, at least, mitochondria (but not chloroplasts) are transmitted paternally (Havey et al. 1998). The mitochondrial genome is very variable in size, being from ca 379,000-2,900,000 bp long, the shorter sequences, at least, having expanded by the acquisition of chloroplast sequences and the accumulation of numerous short repeats (Alverson et al. 2010; see also Bellot &amp; Renner 2015: Apodanthaceae), and the genome is organised as a number of circular chromosomes (Alverson et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Economic Importance.</b> Cucurbitaceae were particularly important in early agriculture in the Americas, being one of the triumvirate of squash, corn and beans. For discussion of various aspects of the history of cultivation of <i>Lagenaria</i> and <i>Cucurbita</i> in particular, see Teppner (2004). For the domestication of squash (<i>Cucurbita</i> spp., inc. <i>C. moschata</i> and <i>C. agyrosperma</i>) which began ca 10,000 years ago, see Dillehay et al. (2007), Piperno et al. (2009) and Ranere et al. (2009); Kates et al. (2017) provide the background to ideas about domestication by looking at relationships within the genus using 44 nuclear loci - instructive. Sebastian et al. (2010) suggest that the relatives of cucumber and melon (<i>Cucumis</i>) are Asian-Australian. Kistler et al. (2014) proposed that the pre-Columbian global distribution of the bottle gourd, <i>Lagenaria siceraria</i>, was in part caused by gourds drifting across the Atlantic from Africa to South America; seeds can remain viable for about a year in sea water, and simulations suggested that gourds could drift across the Atlantic between the equator and 20<sup>o</sup>S in less than this time. For the origin of watermelons (<i>Citrullus</i>), bedevilled by misidentifications in the past, see Chomicki and Renner (2014). See also papers in Grumet et al. (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Cucurbitaceae produce phytoalexins only with difficulty (Harborne 1999). Raffinose is the main transport carbohydrate (Turgeon &amp; Ayre 2005). Distinctive long-chain fatty acids occur in the seed oils; eleostearic acid, an isomer of punicic acid, is restricted to Joliffieae (Hopkins 1990). There are crystalloid inclusions in the protein bodies found in embryos of this family, perhaps unusual for flowering plants (Lott 1981). Phytoliths are commonly produced by members of this family (Piperno 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A number of African Cucurbitaceae have swollen stem bases. The ring of fibres in the stems of <i>Cucurbita</i>, at least, has nothing to do with the vascular bundles (Blyth 1958). <i>Acanthosicyos</i> has paired thorns at the nodes, but I do not know anything about their development; <i>Xerosicyos</i> is a  woody, succulent-leaved vine. Vascularisation of the leaf is complex, e.g. the leaf being supplied by one of the outer ring of bundles in its entirety and by branches from two other bundles of the outer ring, the bud being supplied by the inner ring (Sensarma 1955). Indeed, as the literature summarized by Sensarma (1955) suggests, there has been much speculation about the nature of the cauline vascular system and, related to this and based on how leaves are supplied  from the cauline system, whether from the inner or inner + outer rings of bundles, about the presumed cauline versus foliar nature of the tendrils.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the determination of the "sex" of the flower, see Chuck (2010). Flowers in taxa in which the androecium has two pairs of stamens and a single stamen, four stamens and a staminode (<i>Gerrardanthus</i>), etc., are strictly speaking monosymmetric.  The petals of <i>Xerosicyos</i> are free; those of <i>Echinocystis</i> and <i>Lagenaria</i> at least have several traces. When the stamens are connate 2 + 2 + 1, the vascular supply shows evidence of this, although there are differences over the interpretation of the apparently bithecal stamens (e.g. de Wilde &amp; Duyfjes 1999); Schaefer and Renner (2011; see also Renner &amp; Schaefer 2016) suggest that the plesiomorphic condition of the family is to have five bithecal stamens. Several tubes may arise from the one pollen grain (the pollen is polysiphonous), and some Cucurbiteae have very large almost spherical grains up to 200 &micro;m or so long and across. The carpellate flower may have two rings of what can be interpreted as rudimentary anthers, while in the staminate flowers a ring of processes may alternate with the stamens. The nucellar beak is very large, in some species directly abutting placental tissue; depending on the species, the pollen-tube may swell up considerably there (Lizarazu &amp; Pozner 2014). The chalazal haustorium of the embryo sac of <i>Sechium</i> [= <i>Sicyos</i>] <i>edule</i>, at up to 19,000 &micro;m long, is apparently the longest in the family, although others are also quite long; only some Santalales have longer embryo sacs (Mikesell 1990; Johri et al. 1992). Seedlings commonly have a peg, a cortical outgrowth towards the bottom of the hypocotyl at the root-shoot transition (e.g. Klebs 1884 for a list of taxa); this is not found in species in which germination is hypogeal (Zimmermann 1922).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Renner et al. (2002) suggested that Cucurbitoideae were probably monophyletic, with <i>Thladiantha</i> sister to the rest; tribes of Fevilleoideae (Zanonioideae) formed an unresolved basal polytomy. This was largely confirmed by Kocyan et al. (2007), although <i>Indofevillea</i> was sister to other Cucurbitoideae; monophyly of  Fevilleoideae was not well suppported, <i>Alsomitra</i> sometimes appearing as sister to Cucurbitoideae. Schaefer and Renner (2008a) also found that Fevilleoideae were paraphyletic and so did not recognise the subfamily. There may be a grade of four clades basal to a well-supported Cucurbitoideae, in which Indofevilleeae were well supported as being sister to the rest. This basal grade includes Gomphogyneae - only moderate support, <i>Alsomitra</i> sister to the rest of the tribe, a strongly supported Fevilleeae, Zanonieae, with  76% ML bootstrap, and a strongly supported Actinostemmateae, although relationships between these clades had no support (Schaefer et al. 2009; Schaefer &amp; Renner 2011b). Schaefer et al. (2009) used a topology in which [Gomphogyneae [Triceratieae + Zanonieae]] were sister to the rest of the family, <i>Actinostemma</i> being placed within Zanonieae, in their reconstructions. H.-L. Li et al. (2015), M. Sun et al. (2016) and Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016) also provide extensive details of relationships within the family, the basal topology in the latter in particular being similar to that just discussed. Establishment of the topology within the basal polytomy is important since it may well affect optimisation of characters on the tree.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Cucurbitoideae, phylogenetic studies suggest that Jeffrey's tribes (Jeffrey 2005) are largely monophyletic, although his subtribes are not (Kocyan et al. 2007). Jobst et al. (1998: ITS) found Benincaseae (Cucurbitoideae) to be polyphyletic; Chung et al. (2003) and Schaefer et al. (2008, esp. 2009: <i>Alsomitra</i> in Zanonieae) also looked at relationships within Cucurbitoideae. Schaefer et al. (2009) found <i>Indofevillea</i> to be sister to Cucurbitoideae. For smaller-scale studies within Cucurbitoideae, see Ghebretinsae et al. (2007), Wilde and Duyfjes (2006), Renner et al. (2007a), Schaefer and Renner (2010), Duchen and Renner (2010), Sebastian et al. (2010: <i>Cucumis</i>), Sebastian et al. (2012: <i>Sicyos</i>) and de Boer et al. (2015: Benincaseae).</p>
 
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For the suprageneric classification I follow Schaefer and Renner (2011b);  the latter provide a comprehensive tribal classification which should be consulted for details (see also Renner &amp; Schaefer 2016; c.f. Jeffrey 2005).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are many small genera in Cucurbitaceae, and generic limits need attention, thus Ghebretinsae et al. (2007) had to adjust the limits of <i>Cucumis</i>; see also Wilde and Duyfjes (2006), Renner et al. (2007a) and Schaefer et al. (2009). Sebastian et al. (2012) included 13 of these small genera in <i>Sicyos</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Crown-group <i>Begonia</i> is estimated to be (29.4-)22.3(-14.9) m.y. (Moonlight et al. 2015) - or 37.3-23.2 m.y. (Clement et al. 2004, see Errata 2005), although other estimates put diversification of the genus as occurring some time from the Eocene to early Oligocene 45-25 m.y.a. during a period of global cooling (Goodall-Copestake et al. 2009: sampling extensive) or (31-)24(-18.2) m.y.a. (95% HPD: Thomas et al. 2011b, focus on Malesia).  </p>

<ul><li>Begoniaceae may be recognised by their succulent, herbaceous habit and often two-ranked leaves the blades of which have asymmetric bases and well developed teeth. The hairs are often large, flattened, or almost setular. The plants are monoecious, the staminate and carpellate flowers often have different numbers of tepals, both stigmas and anthers are bright yellow, and the fruit is often winged.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The age of <i>Hillebrandia</i>, perhaps 58 m.y. (Clement et al. 2004, errata 2005), causes some biogeographical problems. The oldest island it is found on is Kaua'i, which is perhaps 5 m.y. old. Either <i>Hillebrandia</i> arrived in the Hawaiian area from some presumably continental region where it is now extinct, or it has been island hopping in the Pacific for up to 50 m.y. or so (for the ages of the Hawaiian island chain and Emperor sea mounts, see Tarduno et al. 2009 and references), or there was some combination of these scenarios (or <i>Hillebrandia</i> may be far younger than previously thought - Renner 2005). Things are not made any easier if <i>Begonia</i> itself initially diversified in Africa (Moonlight et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Begonia</i> may have originated in Africa (see also Moonlight et al. 2015), and sister to the South American and Southeast Asian clades that represent the rest of the genus (whatever the reconstruction) are seasonally adapted species with perennating organs (Goodall-Copestake et al. 2010). Thomas et al. (2011b) found several  invasions of Malesia by <i>Begonia</i> and subsequently generally west-to-east movement. The main clade of Malesian species includes members of four sections, including the speciose section <i>Petermannia</i>, with at least 270 species; the age of that whole clade was (16.5-)11.5(-6.6) m.y. (95% HPD) (Thomas et al. 2011b). Sections in <i>Begonia</i> are generally limited to single continents, but the very recently described <i>B. afromigrata</i>, from Thailand and Laos but in a section otherwise known only from Africa, is an exception (de Wilde et al. 2011). Chinese species of limestone-inhabiting <i>Begonia</i> form a single clade, despite a variety of sectional assignments, and they diversified (11.7-)8.4(-5.3) m.y.a., perhaps 2 m.y. after the origin of the stem group of this clade (Chung et al. 2012). Moonlight et al. (2015) discuss the evolution of the neotropical species, derived from two separate origins from Africa and much subsequent intracontinental movement.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Hughes and Hollingsworth (2008) suggested that the dearth of widespread species in <i>Begonia</i> is due in part to the low levels of gene flow (found in the few studies that have been carried out) and hence for the propensity of divergence in allopatry (and Twyford et al. 2015: also strong reproductive barriers). De Wilde et al. (2011) drew attention to the broader distributions of those species of <i>Begonia</i> that had fleshy fruits compared to the narrower distributions of species with dry fruits - despite the fact that these latter species had minute seeds and perhaps might be supposed to be dispersed easily by wind, and noted that <i>B. afromigrata</i> seemed to have got to southeast Asia from Africa by long distance dispersal.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Hillebrandia</i> has a number of perhaps plesiomorphic features, and some of the features we think of as being characteristic of Begoniaceae as a whole (style position, fruit dehiscence) may in fact be apomorphies for <i>Begonia</i> s.l. alone. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> The diversity of colours and colour patterns and surface textures of the leaves of <i>Begonia</i> is common in other groups that also grow in shady conditions (Gould &amp; Lee 1996; Jacobs et al. 2016 and references).  Blue iridescence in <i>Begonia</i> leaves is caused by the rearrangement of the thylakoids in epidermal chloroplasts (= iridoplasts) that allow them to capture light at green wavelengths, of which there is much in such conditions, and also increases the quantum yield, overall substantially boosting photosynthetic efficiency (Jacobs et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Staminate flowers of Begoniaceae produce pollen, carpellate flowers usually have no reward, but have bright yellow and anther-like stigmas; deceit pollination is probably involved (Schemske et al. 1996;  de Wilde 2001). There are a few ornithophilous species with nectaries at the base of the styles in carpellate flowers only, others have no reward at all; various levels of deceit/mimicry are again involved, male flowers perhaps mimicking females in some cases... (Vogel 1998c; Renner 2006). Artificial hybridisation within <i>Begonia</i> has been extensive. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Tebbit et al. (2006) looked at the evolution of dispersal mechanisms in the speciose Southeast Asian <i>Begonia</i>; within a clade, taxa with animal or rain-ballist dispersal predominate. De Wilde (2011) discussed possible dispersal mechanisms in detail, and de Wilde et al. (2011) focussed on seed dispersal of fleshy-fruited members of the genus, which seem to have wider distributions than their dry-fruited congeners (see also de Lange &amp; Bouman 1992 for seed morphology and disperal in African taxa). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The bottom line is that practically nothing is known about pollination or dispersal.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Animal-Plant Interactions.</u> Butterfly caterpillars are not often found on Begoniaceae (Ehrlich &amp; Raven 1964).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> <i>Begonia</i> is noted for the extent of variation in leaf morphology and the colours and colour patterns on its leaves, making it popular in horticulture. The surface can be quite smooth, minutely bullate, or with almost mountainous up-pushings of the lower surface. Various forms of vegetative reproduction occut. These include "gemmae" borne in groups of cup-shaped structures (aplash cup dispersal) in <i>B. gemmipara</i>, and these apparently develop in the axils of stipules, or plants develope at the petiole-lamina junction or on the lamina itself (?<i>B. phyllomaniaca</i>). Horticulturalists can grow new plants by cutting the midrib/main veins tranversely and placing the leaves on damp soil, as in the <i>B. rex</i> group; plantlets develop quite quickly.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> There may have been a genome duplication somewhere near the base of the <i>Begonia</i> clade some 22 m.y.a. or more (Brennan et al. 2012). For hybridization between species with very different leaf morphologies, etc., see Dewitte et al. (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The vegetative morphology of <i>Begonia</i> is interesting. It is easy to propagate many species of <i>Begonia</i> from parts of leaves, and stems developing from leaves and other odd developments are common in the appropriately-named <i>B. phyllomaniaca</i>.  Barab&eacute; et al. (1992) discuss the development of the distinctively asymmetrical laminaa of the family; Martinez et al. (2016) noted that the leaf bases were mirror-asymmetrical, with auxin concentrations and leaf development as predicted by theory, rather than directionally asymmetrical, i.e. with all leaves asymmetrical in the same way, as in spiral phyllotaxis. For clustered stomata, see Hoover (1986 and references) and Peterson et al. (2010). There are various intermediates between trichomes, leaf teeth, and leaf-like appendages on the leaf, and some taxa have epiphyllous inflorescences  (Dickinson 1978 for references). The leaf teeth are supplied by several veins.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Begoniaceae are somewhat unusual among monoecious taxa with cymose inflorescences in that the first flowers produced in the inflorescence are staminate, carpellate flowers being produced only later; the derived <i>Symbegonia</i> group has racemose inflorescences and shows the reverse arrangement (de Wilde 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are five small orange inner perianth parts (= "petals") in <i>Hillebrandia</i> that are very different from the large white outer perianth members (= "sepals"); the stamens are also orange... (Gauthier &amp; Arros 1963). It has been suggested that the perianth of <i>Begonia</i> is to be compared with the sepals of <i>Hillebrandia</i> (see Gauthier 1959), and also that the petals of <i>Hillebrandia</i> are staminodial (Ronse Decraene &amp; Smets 1990a, comparison with Papaveraceae), which they are in colour but not in position. The plesiomorphic tepal number of <i>Begonia</i> may be four in staminate flowers (a single whorl, c.f. <i>Garcinia</i>, or two bimerous whorls?) and five in carpellate flowers (Forrest et al. 2005). Not surprisingly, symmetry types of flowers is various (e.g. Reyes et al. 2016). De Wilde (2011 and references) noted the variation in vascular supply to members of the perianth, while the vascular bundle to the stamen may be branched (Gauthier 1963).  There is a variety of enothecial thickenings in the family, and some taxa with porose anthers have these thickenings (Tebbitt &amp; Maciver 1999). The stigmas are described as being antisepalous (Davidson 1973); any style is at most short.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For floral development, see Charpentier et al. (1989), for ovules, Boesewinkel and de Lange (1983) and Chandrasekhara Naidu (1985), for placentation, de Wilde and Arends (1989), for seed morphology, de Lange and Bouman (1999 and references), and for general information, see Sandt (1921) and especially de Wilde (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> <i>Hillebrandia</i>, from Hawaii, is sister to <i>Begonia</i> as a whole, including <i>Symbegonia</i> (Clement et al. 2001, esp. 2004; Swensen et al. 2001), however,  H.-L. Li et al. (2015) found that <i>Symbegonia sanguinea</i> was sister [<i>Hillebrandia</i> + <i>B. poculifera</i>] - only these three species were included. For phylogenetic relationships within <i>Begonia</i>, see Plana et al. (2004), Forrest and Hollingsworth (2003) and Forrest et al. (2005). Thomas et al. (2011a), focusing on Asian <i>Begonia</i>, emphasized that several sections were para- or poplyphyletic, while Thomas et al. (2011b) showed that there had been several invasions of Malesia, including one now represented by members of four sections.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For a sectional classification, etc., of <i>Begonia</i>, see Doorenbos et al. (1998), and for the species of the genus, see Smith et al. (1986), Golding and Wasshausen (2002) and Tebbitt (2005: more horticultural).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Botanical Trivia.</b> The 39  genera described by Klotzsch and all now synonymized under <i>Begonia</i> must be close to a record.</p>

<p><u>[? + Apodanthaceae]</u>: ?</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The age of a clade [Apodanthaceae [[Begoniaceae + Cucurbitaceae]] has been estimated as (91.9-)75.1(-58.6) m.y.o. by Naumann et al. (2013), while estimates for a stem age for the family ranged from (98-)81-65(-45) m.y.a. in Bellot and Renner (2014b). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The age of crown-group Apodanthaceae was estimated to be (77-)57-33(-25) m.y.a. (Bellot &amp; Renner 2014b: high-end ages, some older than stem-group estimates, ignored). </p>

<ul><li>All Apodanthaceae occur as groups of rather small, sessile flowers growing along the stems of their hosts. The perianth of the flowers is free and more or less spreading, the stigma is conspicuous and mound-like in the centre of both staminate and carpellate flowers, and the ovary is inferior.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Recorded hosts include Fabaceae (<i>Pilostyles</i>) and Salicaceae (<i>Apodanthes</i>) (Bellot &amp; Renner 2014a).  Its distribution is probably an underestimate, since in Africa it is a parasite of e.g. the widespread <i>Brachystegia</i> and <i>Julbernardia</i> in the Miombo woodland (White 1983); it has also been mistaken for a rust...</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the effect of <i>Pilostyles</i> on the wood structure of its host, <i>Mimosa</i>, see do Amaral and Ceccantini (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Apodanthaceae are pollinated by short-tongued flies and possibly by wasps, too, and the fruits are animal dispersed (Bellot &amp; Renner 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Bellot and Renner (2015) examined the plastomes of two species of <i>Pilostyles</i> (from different continents) and found only five to six functional genes remaining and minute but probably circular plastomes lacking an inverted repeat. There were numerous plastid regions in the nucleus and particularly mitochondrion, although it is possible some of these may have come from the host (Bellot &amp; Renner 2015); the mitochondrial genome of those Cucurbitaceae examined also show a propensity to take up sequences from the other genomes (Alverson et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the much increased rate of variation in synonymous substitution in some mitochondrial genes, see Mower et al. (2007 and references). Barkman et al. (2007) found that mitochondrial genes (<i>atp</i>1) from host Fabaceae had moved to <i>Pilosyles thurberi</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b>   There are cushions of hairs at the bases of the inner perianth parts. Interpreting the meristicity of the flower is not easy, and the androecium in particular is difficult to understand (Blarer et al. 2004). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For information,
see Harms (1935a: general), Kuijt (1969: general), Rutherford (1970: esp. anatomy, cytology), Takhtajan et al. (1985: pollen), Visser (1981), Blarer et al. (2004: floral morphology). For vesicular cells, see Blarer et al. (2002, 2004) and for a detailed study of <i>Pilostyles ingae</i>, see Endriss (1902). The <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/',600,500)">Parasitic Plants website</a> (Nickrent 1998 onwards) and Heide-J&oslash;rgensen (2008) - both general - can be consulted with profit.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Phylogeny.</u> For relationships within the family, see Filipowicz and Renner (2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b>  Apodanthaceae, like other holoparasitic angiosperms, were often previously included in Rafflesiaceae s.l., Rafflesiaceae s.s. here is included in <a href="malpighialesweb.htm#Rafflesiaceae" target="home">Malpighiales</a>. Relationships of Apodanthaceae with Malvales have been suggested, some Malvaceae in particular lacking normal anther thecal structure, the androecium may be fused, etc. (e.g. Blarer et al. 2004; Endress &amp; Matthews 2006a; Sch&ouml;nenberger &amp; von Balthazar 2006).</p>
