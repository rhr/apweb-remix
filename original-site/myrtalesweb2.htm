<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2001: note topology) dated crown Myrtales to (83-)79, 75(-71) m. years,  Hengchang Wang et al. (2009) to (89-)85, 78(-74) m.y., although a Bayesian relaxed clock estimate for the crown group was as much as 99 m.y., Tank et al. (2015: Table S2) ca 86 m.y., and Bell et al. (2010: note topology) offered dates of (99-)89 m. years. Thornhill et al. (2012a) suggest several dates, but they are all clustered around (98-)93.3-91.7(-85.7) m.y.a.; an age of ca 111 m.y. was suggested by Sytsma et al. (2004), (118.8-)116.4(-113.7) m.y. by Berger et al. (2015), ca 90 m.y. by Sytsma and Berger (2011), and (96.4-)91.6(-86.7) m.y. by  Thornhill et al. (2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fossils assignable to Myrtales are some 65 m.y. old (Crepet et al. 2004).</p>


<ul><li>Myrtales may be recognised by their often flaky bark;
opposite leaves with colleters, at most small stipules and strong intramarginal
veins; flowers with petals that are clawed or at least very narrow at the base,
a more or less inferior ovary, and a usually nectariferous hypanthium. The sepals are often valvate and the stamens are usually
incurved in bud.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Note:</b>  <b>Boldface</b> denotes possible apomorphies, (....) denotes a feature common in the clade, exact status uncertain, [....] includes explanatory material. Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Myrtales contain ca 6% core eudicot diversity (Magall&oacute;n et al. 1999). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Berger et al. (2015) discuss the biogeography and diversification of Myrtales in some detail, noting that most families were southern hemisphere, ancestrally being in South America (Lythraceae, Melatomataceae, Onagraceae, Vochysiaceae) or African (the [Crypteroniaceae [Alzateaceae + Penaeaceae]] clade, Myrtaceae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Salt tolerance has evolved quite often here, most notably in Combretaceae (12 spp.) Lythraceae (21 spp.) and Myrtaceae (47 spp.: Moray et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination.</u> Energetically costly elements of floral display s(e.g. large flowers)  have evolved in parallel in Myrtales, low cost floral elements (e.g. small flowers, shallow flowers) show phylogenetic inertia (i.e. are plesiomorphic?) - see Vasconcelos and Proen&ccedil;a (2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Lycaenidae caterpillars are quite commonly to be found on members of this order, especially Lythraceae, Myrtaceae, and Combretaceae (Fielder 1991, 1995).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Several characters common in Myrtales may be apomorphies there. Raffinose and stachyose are common oligosaccharides in phloem exudate in Myrtaceae, Onagraceae, Lythraceae and Combretaceae, at least (Zimmermann &amp; Ziegler 1975). Polyderm (alternating
endodermal and parenchymatous layers laid down by a pericyclic meristem) is known
from families like Onagraceae, Lythraceae, Myrtaceae, and probably Penaeaceae, at least (Mylius 1913), while in roots of some aquatic Lythraceae, Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae and Onagraceae (and Euphorbiaceae and Fabaceae) there is a distinctive lacunate cork produced from a pericyclic cork cambium (Little &amp; Stockey 2006); there may also be lacunae in the stem polyderm produced in response to flooding (Lempe et al. 2001). The cork cambium is sometimes initiated in the superficial or mid-cortical position (e.g. Myrtaceae, Melastomataceae. Tracheoidal sclereids with spiral wall thickenings that are associated with the vein endings are known from Vochysiaceae, Lythraceae, Combretaceae, Melastomataceae, Alzateaceae and Penaeaceae (Sajo &amp; Rudall 2002); their more general distribution needs to be checked. Since there is internal phloem, petiole and midrib bundles are often bicollateral; Carlquist (2013) noted the occurrence of interxylary phloem in some Combretaceae, Melastomataceae, Onagraceae and Lythraceae. Weberling (2000) notes that &quot;true
rudimentary stipules&quot; occur in Myrtaceae and most myrtalean families; stipules, when they occur, are indeed generally small, often not vascularized,  and are likely to be colleters (see also Carr &amp; Carr 1966; LaFrankie 2010; da Silva et al. 2012); colleters may also occur in the flowers (Pimentel et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In Myrtaceae the calyx and corolla originate at about the same time, while in Lythraceae and Onagraceae the calyx is visible considerably before the corolla (Mayr 1969); it will be interesting to know the general distribution of this feature. Many Myrtales, including
some Myrtaceae, have notably narrow petal bases, i.e., they are close to being clawed; the definition and
distribution of clawed petals in Myrtales may have to be amended, but I have provisionally put "clawed petals" as a feature of the whole clade. Those taxa in which the filaments are straight
in bud usually have short filaments, and the length
of the style is correlated in part with the length of the hypanthial tube. Distinctive winged fruits are found in Combretaceae and rarely in <i>Oenothera</i>, and even more distinctive fruits that open by the placenta breaking through the ovary wall occur throughout <i>Cuphea</i> (Lythraceae) and in some <i>Sonerila</i> (Melastomataceae). The basic chromosome number for the order may be x = 12 (Graham et al. 1993).</p>

Almeda (1997: chromosome numbers).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> The position of Myrtales within the rosids was unstable in a <i>rbc</i>L analysis of all angiosperms (Hilu et al. 2003). However, there was some support for a position sister to all other rosids except Geraniales, Vitales and Saxifragales (Zhu et al. 2007), while Wang et al. (2009) suggested that is was sister to Geraniales, the combined group being sister to all other malvids.  See also the <a href="dillenialesweb.html#RosAstetal" target="home">Pentapetalae</a> and <a href="http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/orders/Saxvitros.htm#Saxifragales" target="home">Saxifragales</a> pages for further discussion on the relationships of Myrtales.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Relationships within the order have been extensively studied by Conti et al. (1996, 1998, 1999, 2002), Sytsma et al. (1998, esp. 2004),
Clausing and Renner (2001: Melastomataceae), Sch&ouml;nenberger and Conti (2001, 2003: esp. Penaeaceae area, etc.) and Wilson et al. (2005: Myrtaceae s.l.), and the tree is based on these publications. The position of Combretaceae seems still to be unclear (see also Maurin et al. 2010; M. Sun et al. 2016), and Berger and Sytsma (2010), Bell et al. (2010) and  Soltis et al. (2011) find at least some support for a position sister to [Onagraceae + Lythraceae]. Anatomy (vestured pits), some morphological features (general leaf type and insertion) and molecular data all strongly suggest that Vochysiaceae are to be included in
Myrtales, but at first sight the distinctive monosymmetric spurred flowers of that family are quite unlike those of the rest of the order. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Crown Combretaceae are ca 46 m.y.o. (Sytsma et al. 2004) or (106.5-)102.6(-98.9) m.y. (Berger et al. 2015); <i>Strephonema</i> diverged soon after the origin of stem Combretaceae at ca 90 m.y.a. (Sytsma &amp; Berger 2011). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fossils of <i>Esgueiria</i>, assigned to Combretaceae, are widespread in the Northern Hemisphere in Late Cretaceous deposits ca 90-70 m.y. old. They seem to have inferior unilocular ovaries with apical placentation and glandular-peltate hairs (Friis et al. 1992, 2011), there is no hypanthium, of the eight stamens, five are in one whorl and three in another, the styles are more or less separate, and the surface of the unicellular hairs of the Japanese, but not the Portugese, material is distinctly rough (Takahashi et al. 1999). The nature of the nectary is unclear; in some specimens there are structures outside the androecium that have been interpreted as possible nectaries (Takahashi et al. 1999), unlike the nectaries in extant Combretaceae. The identity of these fossils should be confirmed - to be compared with Hydrangeaceae? <i>Dilcherocarpus</i>, from the Albian-Cenomanian of the Dakota Group, Kansas, and ca 100 m.y. old, has been assigned to Combretaceae (Manchester &amp; O'Leary 2010).</p>

<ul><li>Combretaceae may not be very easy to recognise,
although like other Myrtales they often have opposite leaves and flaking bark. The trees quite often look rather pagoda-like, the branches often being in whorls and consisting of flattened sprays of leaf rosettes (the <i>Terminalia</i> pattern). The leaves are entire
and may have pellucid dots, surface glands (also on the petiole), or domatia. The indumentum is commonly adpressed and
distinctive enough under the microscope; nodes are unilacunar. The flowers are often rather small and
massed in spicate inflorescences, the hypanthium can be quite long, but the
corolla is small or absent. The ovary
is inferior, and the single-seeded fruit is often flattened and/or winged.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For the fossil record of winged fruits that can be assigned to Combretaceae, see  Manchester and O'Leary (2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Diversification of most of the family is a Caenozoic phenomenon (Sytsma &amp; Berger 2011), indeed, there was a significant shift in speciation rates in Combreteae, but when that occurred is unclear (Berger et al. 2015). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Lumnitzera</i> and <i>Laguncularia</i> are mangrove taxa (see articles in <i>Ann. Bot.</i> 115(3). 2015); for more on the mangrove habitat, see <a href="malpighialesweb.htm#Rhizophoraceae" target="home">Rhizophoraceae</a>.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Seed Dispersal.</u> The flattened and/or winged fruits of Combretaceae are often wind- or water dispersed, and Systma and Berger (2011) note substantial dispersal of the family in the Pacific.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Wood fibres are usually non-septate, but
those of Lythraceae, at least, are septate. The islands of included phloem in <i>Combretum</i> are connected in a reticulating fashion (Robert et al. 2011); den Outer and van Veenendaal (1995) noted that this system was more important in the transport of assimilates that the phloem outside the xylem - and that it was interesting that these plants were shrubs or trees, not lianas where odd vascular construction is almost the norm. Keating (1985) describes the
stomata as being paracytic while Dahgren and Thorne (1985) call them
anomocytic; in any event, variation in stomatal morphology is extensive (Tilney 2002). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are hairs lining the
ovary loculus walls in <i>Combretum</i>. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some
information is taken from Stace (2006: general; 2010: New World taxa), Graham (1964:
general), Verhoeven and van der Schijff (1974: anatomy, inc. root cork cambium), Mauritzon (1939a), Fagerlind (1941a) and Venkateswarlu (1952b), all embryology, Venkateswarlu and Prakash Rao (1971) and Jongkind (1995), both <i>Strephonema</i>, El Ghazali et al. (1998: pollen). For obdiplostemony, see
Eckert (1966, also Tomlinson

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> <i>Strephonema</i> may be sister to the rest of the family. <i>Lumnitzera</i> and <i>Laguncularia</i>, both mangrove plants, are sister taxa, but <i>Conocarpus</i>, also found in similar habitats, is not immediately related (Tan et al. 2002; Maurin et al. 2010). Indeed, M. Sun et al. (2016) found that <i>Conocarpus</i> was sister to the rest of the family, although otherwise relationships are as noted above. Maurin et al. (2010) in particular discuss details of relationships within the family, especially in the large genera <i>Terminalia</i> and <i>Combretum</i>. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For generic limits, especially around <i>Combretum</i>, see Stace (2007), while Maurin et al. (2010) suggest that the limits of <i>Terminalia</i>, currently paraphyletic, be expanded; support values underpinning change in neither case are very high.</p>

Since both may be sister to the rest of their respective families, working out where floral merism changes on the tree becomes difficult. A number of Lythraceae, including <i>Trapa</i>, have capitate stigmas, and this could be another feature uniting the two families.</p>

<ul><li>Onagraceae are herbs to shrubs that are recognisable by their usually opposite and quite often toothed leaves with small stipules and the usually 4-merous flowers with an inferior
ovary and a well-developed floral tube. The calyx is usually rather thin, reflexed, and deciduous, there are up to eight stamens,
and the pollen has viscin threads, so it is conspicuously clumped.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For the fossil history of the family, see Gr&iacute;msson et al. (2011a) and Lee et al. (2013) and references; the fossil pollen is very distinctive and is known from the Maastrichtian, at least 66 m.y.a..</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Some caterpillars are found both on Vitaceae and Onagraceae (Forbes 1956) - and both contain raphides. Different rusts occur on Onagroideae and Jussiaeaoideae (Savile 1979b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> For details of floral morphology in Onagraceae and its relation to pollination, see Wagner et al. (2007). Pollination in North American members of the family has been studied in great detail (e.g. references in Linsley et al. 1973; Clinebell et al. 2004). Interestingly, 12 species of oligolectic <i>Andrena</i> bees are major visitors to <i>Camissonia campestris</i> alone (Linsley et al. 1973), while Clinebell et al. (2004) documented a wide variety of potenital pollinators visiting the four species of Onagraceae and three other species that they studied. How petal spots develop in <i>Clarkia gracilis</i> has recently been worked out in some detail (Martins et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Protogyny is common here; the non-protogynous taxa are either protandrous or undecided in equal numbers (Newman 1993). For a general survey of reproductive biology in Onagraceae, see Raven (1979).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> All the chromosomes in some species of <i>Oenothera</i> form a ring, joined by a series of permanent translocations; the whole genome forms a single linkage unit (Cleland 1972). There is paternal transmission of chloroplasts. Particular combinations of genome and plastome may be incompatible, and the resultant inviability  of some genome/plastome combinations may provide genetic barriers between taxa (Stubbe &amp; Steiner 1999). Although these permanent translocation hybrids self, they show an increased diversification rate over sexual species, interestingly, there are frequent reversals from the hybrid state to sexuality (Johnson et al. 2011). The whole system sometimes breaks down (see Harte 1993: the contributions of <i>Oenothera</i> to biology; Stubbe &amp; Steiner 1999 and references: translocation, etc; Wagner et al. 2007). Golczyk et al. (2014) found that breaks occurred subterminally between between two distinct chromatin regions, and there were no normal telomeres; translocation did not involve whole arms.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The stipules of <i>Ludwigia</i> can be quite prominent.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are some very distinctive floral morphologies in Onagroideae. Thus <i>Circaea</i> has only two deeply-lobed petals (adaxial-abaxial) and two lateral stamens, the latter being opposite the sepals. The strongly monosymmetric flowers of <i>Lopezia</i> have only a single abaxial stamen that becomes extrorse and a petal-like adaxial staminode; the two adaxial petals may be recurved and have pseudonectaries on their
claws (Eyde &amp; Morgan 1973). <i>Gongylocarpus</i> has sessile flowers, as is quite common in Onagraceae, but after pollination the ovary becomes completely enveloped by stem tissue. The viscin threads that characterize the family vary considerably in morphology, often being annular-vermiform, but they are also smooth or irregularly beaded (Skvarla et al. 1976). The style of <i>Ludwigia</i> has minor bundles, but these are absent in other members of the family. In <i>Oenothera</i>, more than one spore from the same megaspore mother cell may germinate and - presumably - compete (Noher de Halac &amp; Harte 1977). x = 10, 11, 15 in the basal clades of Onagroideae, ?18 in Epilobeae, and 7 in Onagreae (Wagner et al. 2007). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For other information, see Johansen (1928: hypostase and its correlation with the environment),  Eyde (1982: floral anatomy), Maheshwari (1947), Tobe and Raven (1986a, b, 1987d, 1996) and Hoch et al. (1993: variation in anther septum development, embryology), Praglowski et al. (1983, 1994: pollen), Skvarla et al. (1978: viscin threads), Tobe et al.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> <i>Ludwigia</i> is sister to the rest of the family, and within <i>Ludwigia</i>, taxa with five and those with ten stamens form separate clades (Barber et al. 2008). Knowledge of relationships along the backbone of the tree seems to be stabilising [<i>Hauya</i> [[<i>Fuchsia</i> + <i>Circaea</i>] [<i>Lopezia</i> [<i>Gongylocarpus</i> [Epilobeae + Onagreae]]]]] may be the structure (Levin et al. 2003, 2004), however, Ford and Gottlieb (2007) found a clade [<i>Hauya</i> [<i>Fuchsia</i> + <i>Circaea</i>]] that was sister to other Onagroideae (see also M. Sun et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Wagner et al. (2007) enumerate all supraspecific taxa. Reflecting the new, but for the most part well supported phylogeny of the family, generic limits have been adjusted, so <i>Oenothera</i> has been expanded and <i>Camissonia</i> very much cut up (e.g. Levin et al. 2004); for appropriate nomenclatural changes, see Hoch and Wagner (2007). The <a href="javascript:showImage('http://botany.si.edu/Onagraceae/',600,500)">Onagraceae website</a> contains a largely up-to-date summary of classification, etc. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Botanical Trivia.</b> In 1827 Robert Brown recorded the phenomenon that is now called Brownian motion when observing the pollen grains of <i>Clarkia pulchella</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Hugo de Vries thought that the abrupt appearance of <i>O. lamarckiana</i> was an example of normal evolution, which for him was a process in which mutation = major change/speciation, natural selection not being involved. However, <i>O. lamarckiana</i> is a morphological variant caused by the breakdown of the permanent translocation system mentioned above (c.f. Linnaeus and <i>Peloria</i> [= <i>Linaria</i>, Plantaginaceae]).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Estimates of the age of the family  are (65-)50, 46(-29) m.y. (Bell et al. 2010: minus <i>Deocodon</i>),  ca 60 m.y.o. (Sytsma et al. 2004) or rather older, (99.7-)95.5(-91.7) m.y. (Berger et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">However, fossil evidence suggests that a crown group age for the whole family is likely to be at least 85 m.y.. Pollen from Montana dated to the Lower Campanian 82-81 m.y.a. has reliably been identified as <i>Lythrum</i> or its segregate, <i>Peplis</i>; there is somewhat younger (72-78 m.y.) pollen from Siberia (Gr&iacute;msson et al. 2011b: exquisite micrographs; S. Graham 2013 for a summary). The fossil <i>Trapago</i> is found in deposits 73-65 m.y. old, and other fossils assignable to Myrtales in general are perhaps slightly older (Crepet et al. 2004 and references). </p>

<ul><li>Lythraceae are herbs to trees that are recognisable by their flaky bark,
opposite, entire leaves that lack gland dots, flowers with a ribbed hypanthium or K + C tube, a rather
thick, valvate calyx - an epicalyx is common, clawed petals that are crumpled in bud, and often 10 or
more stamens of unequal lengths. The ovary is more or less
superior, and the fruit is usually a capsule; the testa of about half the genera has distinctive, initially inverted mucilaginous  hairs.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> <i>Sonneratia</i>, a mangrove genus, has a long fossil record, its pollen, <i>Florschuetzia</i>, being distinctive (M&uuml;ller 1978, 1984), and it may be Oligocene in age; for the evolution of the mangrove habitat, see <a href="malpighialesweb.htm#Rhizophoraceae" target="home">Rhizophoraceae</a>. <i>Decodon</i>, now restricted to eastern North American, was widely distributed in the North Hemisphere from the Eocene onwards and was more divese than it is now (Ferguson et al. 1997 and references; Little et al. 2004); it is also known from the late Cretaceous of Mexico (Gr&iacute;msson et al. 2012). See Graham (2013) for a summary and evaluation of the fossil record of the family.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u>  <i>Sonneratia</i>, with ca 7 species, is a notable element of <a href="malpighialesweb.htm#Rhizophoraceae" target="home">mangrove</a> vegetation from Southeast Asia to the Pacific; see also articles in <i>Ann. Bot.</i> 115(3). 2015.</p>
 
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Seed Dispersal.</u> Taxa whose seeds have mucilaginous hairs are more or less myxospermous; the hairs evert when the seed is wetted (Western 2011 for references). The fruits of <i>Cuphea</i> open by the placenta expanding and moving laterally, breaking through both the thin ovary wall and the hypanthium; the seeds are exposed on the placenta.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> S. Graham and Cavalcanti (2001) suggest that x = 8 is the basic chromosome number for the family.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The stamens may be held on one side of the flower (also in some Onagraceae) and so causing rather weak monosymmetry; this is much more marked in Melastomataceae. Some species of <i>Cuphea</i>, e.g. <i>C. glutinosa</i>, have quite strongly monosymmetric flowers. Androecial development is both centrifugal and centripetal (Weberling 1989 and references; Ronse Decraene &amp; Smets 1991). Pollen is notably variable (Graham 2006).  Species of the large genus <i>Cuphea</i> consistently have eleven stamens. When G = K, the carpels may
alternate with or be opposite to them, when G = 2, the carpels may be
transverse or median, when G = 3, the odd carpel is adaxial (Eichler 1878;
Baillon 1877; Spichiger et al. 2002). Ovule morphology varies considerably. In taxa like <i>Trapa</i>, <i>Sonneratia</i> and <i>Cuphea</i> the embryo sac is much elongated, the nucellus sometimes being massive. There is usually a postament, and the base of the endosperm may be abruptly narrowed and protrudes into the hypostase (see e.g. T&auml;ckholm 1915; Tischler 1917; Mauritzon 1934e; Joshi and Venkateswarlu 1936; Venkateswarlu 1937; Ram 1956: <i>Trapa</i>, and references). Taxa with everting testa hairs, which vary in their morphologies, are unique to the family but are scattered through it (S. A. Graham &amp; Graham 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The inferior ovary of <i>Punica granatum</i> is unique in flowering plants, appearing to have two (or three) superposed layers of carpels, the basal with axile and the others with intrusive parietal placentation; the placentation is fundamentally axile, the appearance of parietal placentation being the result of growth at the base of the ovary (Sinha &amp; Joshi 1959 for vasculature; Leins 1988 for androecial development). In the other species of the genus, <i>P. proto-punica</i>, there is a more ordinary semi-inferior ovary.  The seeds of <i>Punica</i> have a sarcotesta, although this is often described as being an aril, not least by Wikipedia.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Tobe et al. (1998: morphological matrix) and S. Graham (1964, 2006); for some vegetative anatomy, see Little et al. (2004), for pollen, see Muller (1981b) and A. Graham et al. (1990, for ovules, see Mauritzon (1939a), and for seed anatomy and morphology, see Gr&uuml;tter (1893) and S. Graham and Graham (2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> S. Graham et al. (2005) found maximum parsimony support for the topology [<i>Decodon</i> [[<i>Lythrum</i> + <i>Peplis</i>] [remainder of the family]]]; the remainder of the family formed two large clades. However, support along the back-bone was weak, and in maximum likelihood analyses there was weak support for the three genera just mentioned being sister to one of these two clades. Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016) found that <i>Rotala</i> was sister to the rest of the family, but support for this position was weak. If <i>Decodon</i> is sister to the rest of the family, then seeds with mucilage hairs and 6-merous flowers are probably synapomorphies for the rest of the family. The old Sonneratiaceae (<i>Sonneratia</i>
and <i>Duabanga</i>), plants of mangroves, are not monophyletic (Shi et al. 2000; Huang &amp; Shi 2002; S. Graham et al. 2005; Narzary et al. 2016); <i>Sonneratia</i> itself may be sister to <i>Trapa</i> (e.g. Z.-D. Chen et al. 2016). The distinctive <i>Punica</i> was found to be sister to <i>Woodfordia</i> (Narzary et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Rotala</i> and <i>Ammannia</i>, previously thought to be close, are well separated, and relationships within the former genus have been clarified (S. Graham et al. 2011). For a phylogeny of <i>Cuphea</i>, see S. Graham et al. (2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some taxa with particularly distinctive morphologies:</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b>  The age of crown-group Vochysiaceae is some 36-33 m.y. (Sytsma et al. 2004) or  (52-)39(-28) m.y. (Berger et al. 2015).</p>

<ul><li>Vochysiaceae are readily recognisable by the combination of opposite, entire leaves with lateral veins looping and joining near the lamina margin - a
rather ordinary Myrtalean vegetative body - with their rather large and distinctive monosymmetric or asymmetric
flowers with a spurred calyx and a single stamen with a long anther and short filament. Some taxa have large, flat,
stipular glands. </ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The phylogenetic "stem" of Vochysiaceae is around 60 m.y. (Berger et al. 2105). The present distribution of Vochysiaceae on either side of the Atlantic is likely to be the result of dispersal (Sytsma et al. 2004; Berger et al. 2015: differences in detail).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b>  Leaves of small saplings
may have short petioles and swollen leaf bases. At least in <i>Vochysia guatemalensis</i>
there are conspicuous, symmetrically-arranged mucilage canals in the pith; <i>Ruizterania</i> has trilacunar nodes (pers. obs.).</b>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The single stamen may be opposite either
the abaxial-lateral C or the adjacent K; in the latter case, it is off the
plane of symmetry (Kawasaki 1998; also Litt &amp; Stevenson 2003b). The ovary is initiated in an inferior position, the superior position in the mature flower being secondary (Litt 1999; Litt &amp; Stevenson 2003a). Baillon (1874) drew the flower as being inverted and with the odd carpel
adaxial, while Corner (1976) described the ovules of <i>Qualea</i> sp. as being long-exostomal.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a general account, see Kawasaki (2006), for anatomy, see Quirk (1980) and Sajo and Rudall (2002), and for floral development and morphology, see Litt and Stevenson (2003a, b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> relationships are unclear. Erismieae, containing the tropical American <i>Erisma</i> and the West African <i>Erismadelphus</i> and <i>Korupodendron</i>, are monophyletic. They have cortical/subepidermal phellogen; G 1, &plusmn; inferior (perhaps plesiomorphic), 1-2
lateral to apical ovules/carpel; fruit samaroid, with persistent enlarged K;
testa undifferentiated, with vascular bundles. Vochysieae are probably not monophyletic (Litt 1999).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Because of their monosymmetric, spurred flowers Vochysiaceae were often associated with families that are no longer thought to be at all closely related. They often included <i>Euphronia</i>
(e.g. Mabberley 1997; Takhtajan 1997: see Malpighiales-Euphroniaceae), and Takhtajan's
(1997) Vochysiales included
families like Malpighiaceae (Malpighiales), Tremandraceae (= Oxalidales-Elaeocarpaceae) and Krameriaceae (Zygophyllales); Cronquists' (1981) Polygalales was even more heterogeneous  </p>

(Berger et al. 2015); ages in Wilson (2011) are largely  similar. In a comprehensive analysis also using fossil pollen, Thornhill et al.

<ul><li>Myrtaceae are often aromatic plants recognisable by their flaky bark, their
entire, punctate leaves, and their imbricate calyx, often rather fugaceous
corolla, and androecium with numerous conspicuous stamens each often with an apical
gland. In fact, in leaf, flower and
fruit there is considerable variation. Many taxa have opposite leaves with a well-developed intramarginal vein;
there is a group of genera with spiral leaves that dry a distinctive, dark,
almost purplish color. Many genera have
inferior ovaries and baccate fruits, while another large group of genera has &plusmn;
superior ovaries and capsules.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For ages of various clades in the family, see Biffin et al. (2010a);  Thornhill et al. (2012a, 2015) and Vasconcelos et al. (2017: Myrteae) also give dates for a number of clades. The pollen record suggests the existence of at least some tribes in the late Cretaceous (Wilson 2011), but this is inconsistent with many molecular  divergence dates (see also Vasconcelos 2017 for an evaluation of much fossil literature). Some dates for the same node diverge widely. Thus crown-group Myrteae are dated to the Cretaceous ca 90 m.y.a. by Murillo-A et al. (2016) and the Miocene ca 18 m.y.a. by  Berger et al. (2016; see also Vasconcelos et al. 2017 for  more literature and dates).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Thornhill et al. (2015) thought that although Myrtaceae may have been Gondwanan in origin, none of the 22 disjunctions they examined could unambiguously be linked to  geological vicariance events. The increasing aridity of the Oligocene-Miocene may have led to the rapid divergence of major clades within the family (Wilson 2011). The shift to fleshy fruits in Syzygieae and Myrteae seems to have been accompanied by increased diversification rates (Biffin et al. 2010a). Myrteae may have originated in the New Zealand-New Caledonia-Australia area, either in the early Palaeocene ca 65.5 m.y.a. (macrofossil evidence) or substantially later in the mid-Eocene ca 40.8 m.y.a. (palynological evidence), and then achieved their broader largely austral distribution via Gondwana (Vasconcelos et al. 2017; see also above). However, not only are dates uncertain, but the status of New Zealand and New Caledonia during this period is unclear: Were they always emergent, or submerged for part of the time, and/or were there metapopulations on ephemeral islands (Vasconcelos et al. 2017; see also Condamine et al. 2016, etc.)? The Mediterranean <i>Myrtus</i> itself is part of a clade that is otherwise from Central and South America.</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">A shift in speciation rates in Myrtaceae has been provisionally placed around the K/P boundary in stem Myrtoideae (Berger et al. 2015), although its exact position and cause(s) remained somewhat unclear. For diversification shifts within Myrteae, see Vasconcelos et al. (2017).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Ladiges et al. (2011, see also 2012) suggested that within two clades of <i>Eucalyptus</i> s.l. there was independent adaptation to arid/semi-arid conditions, and they suggested that the age of <i>Eucalyptus</i> s.l. was Late Cretaceous-Palaeocene. There are fossils of <i>Eucalyptus</i>, possibly of the relatively widespread subgenus <i>Symphyomyrtus</i>, in early Eocene deposits of Argentinian Patagonia ca 51.9 m.y. old (Wilf et al. 2010; esp. Gandolfo et al. 2011; Hermsen et al. 2012), and Hermsen et al. (2012, see also Macphail and Thornhill 2016 and other papers in <i>Australian J. Bot.</i> 64(7-8). 2016), in evaluating this and other fossil evidence, inclined to dating crown-group Eucalypteae to the early Palaeocene or Eoceae, while Thornhill et al. (2015) date crown-group <i>Eucalyptus</i> to (35-)34.4(-33.9) m.y. ago. There are also fossils of <i>Eucalyptus</i> from Early Miocene New Zealand (Rozefelds 1996; Pole 2003). Eucalypteae are no longer found in either South America or New Zealand. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fossils identified as <i>Metrosideros</i>, perhaps subgenus <i>Metrosideros</i>, have recently been discovered in Oligocene deposits ca 30 m.y.o. in Tasmania (Tarran et al. 2016). <i>Metrosideros</i> now grows in eastern Malesia, the Bonin Islands, and throughout Melanesia and Polynesia, including New Caledonia (20< species) and Hawaii, but it is unknown from Australia. <i>Metrosideros polymorpha</i> from Hawai'i is a very important nectar source for birds, and the genus may have radiated from New Zealand, its seeds being dispersed by wind (Wright et al. 2000b, 2001; see also Pillon et al. 2015). Its arrival in Hawai'i is estimated to be a mere (6-)3.9 m.y.a., probably on Kaua'i (Percy et al. 2008). However, understanding the biogeography of the genus is difficult, partly because relationships within it are unclear, and partly because it also includes the South African <i>M. angustifolia</i> and the Chilean <i>M. stipularis</i>, perhaps sister species but whose more precise relationships are unknown (Pillon et al. 2015).</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">The Malesian <i>Syzygium</i> is notably diverse on New Caledonia (ca 70 species: see Biffin et al. 2006 for a phylogeny). In the New World the speciose <i>Myrcia</i> s.l., often a montane plant, may have begun diversifying in the Brazilian Atlantic forest ca 28 (36-21) m.y.a.; it is currently diverse in eastern Brazil, the Caribbean, and the Guiana Highlands (Santos et al. 2017). <i>Eugenia</i> is the most species-rich tree genus in the Mata Altantica forest of Brazil (Mazine et al. 2014), and it moved to Africa from the New World twice (Bernardini et al. 2014). </p>
 
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Psiloxyloideae join other examples in the family of species-poor geographically restricted taxa that are sister to  much more diverse clades (Lucas et al. 2007; Thornhill et al. 2015; Vasconcelos et al. 2017). Sytsma et al. (2004) suggested that <i>Psiloxylon</i> might have been hopping about on islands in the Indian Ocean for almost 40 m.y. (see also Berger et al. 2015: ca 10 m.y.; Thornhill et al. 2015).  </p> 
 
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Interestingly, in <i>Myrcia</i> s.l., ontogeny and phylogeny are inversely linked, that is,  characters that appear later in ontogeny are more indicative of deeper relationships (Vasconcelos et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u>  There are around 1,600 Australian species of Myrtaceae, including ca 800 species of <i>Eucalyptus</i> and friends  (Crisp et al. 2011); <i>Eucalyptus</i> s.l. in particular dominates over 90% of the fire-dependent savannas, woodlands and forests there (Lawler &amp; Foley 2002). Many species of <i>Eucalyptus</i>, with their epicormic buds, volatile oils, open canopy, decorticating bark, etc., can be thought of as fire-promoting plants (Keith 2012), and they can survive these fires.  Thus about 90% of <i>Eucalyptus</i> s.l. species have epicormic strands in their bark, and/or lignotubers, and these epicormic strands are associated with the development of additional axillary buds in the young stems (Burrows 2013, and references). Epicormic strands are initially meristematic strands up to several centimetres long, and although they do not often have organised buds, resprouting occurs from them after even quite severe fires -importantly, resprouting occurs in the canopy. This happens in many species of <i>Eucalyptus</i> s.l. (but not in e.g. <i>E. regnans</i>) as well as in some other Australian Myrtaceae (Burrows 2002; Burrows et al. 2010). Hence <i>Eucalyptus</i>-dominated savanna responds differently to fire than do other savannas, since in the latter woody species with epicormic buds are vanishingly uncommon (Moncrieff et al. 2016). Australian <i>Eucalyptus</i>-dominated savanna is also distinctive becase eucalypts tend to be notably tall and narrow compared with other savanna trees (Moncrieff et al. 2014). Crisp et al. (2011: 95% HPD) link the evolution of these epicormic strands/buds with biome evolution in Australia some (62-)62, 60(-58) m.y.a.; dates for crown-group Eucalypteae in Thornhill et al. (2012) are a little younger - (66.2-)60, 55.3(-50.9) m.y. ago. Eucalypt woodland was once more widespread, occuring in New Zealand at the end of the Early Miocene (along with palms) (Pole 2003) and in Patagonian South America in the early Eocene ca 52 m.y.a. (Hermsen et al. 2012), and its subsequent disappearance in those places may be because climates became wetter (Crisp et al. 2011). Interestingly, crown-group diversification of the Australian <i>Banksia</i> (Proteaceae), many of which are also fire-associated, is also quite early (He et al. 2011); Proteaceae are late Cretaceous in age. For fire in Australia, see Bradstock et al. (2012), Bowman et al. (2012), Carpenter et al. (2015, 2016, also Hill &amp; Jordan 2016; c.f. in part Bond &amp; Scott 2010). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Biomass accumulation in eucalypt woodlands can be great. Average figures of 1,867 tonnes C ha<sup>-1</sup> living and dead biomass have been recorded for <i>Eucalyptus regnans</i>-dominated forests (Keith et al. 2009), but the highest values are ca 1,000 tons more - that is why they make such a bonfire. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Dry-fruited Myrtoideae, including <i>Melaleuca</i> and <i>Eucalyptus</i>, are often ectomycorrhizal (e.g. Chilvers &amp; Pryor 1965: many species of <i>Eucalyptus</i>; Smith &amp; Read 1997; Tedersoo et al. 2008; B&acirc; et al. 2011a; Lalibert&eacute; et al. 2015; see also Moyersoen et al. 2001). They are especially abundant in Australia, but although Brundrett (2009) estimated 1,800 species may be involved, little is known about the eco-physiological dimensions of these associations and the role that they might play in the ecological dominance of Myrtaceae in parts of Australia.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Eucalypts growing in arid environments have thick leaf blades with apparently overly-closely spaced veins ca 24 mm mm<sup>-2</sup>, i.e., the distance between veins is less that the distance between veins and stomata (de Boer et al. 2016; c.f. Zwieniecki &amp; Boyce 2014). This may enable such leaves to achieve maximum photosynthatic rates very soon after rain falls; these leaves are also amphistomatous (de Boer et al. 2016).</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Nine species of <i>Eucalyptus</i>, not immediately related to one another, along with Pinales and a few Dipterocarpaceae, include the majority of giant trees (70< m tall) known (Tng et al. 2012). The giant eucalypts may be an odd sort of rain forest pioneer. They usually depend on fire for their regeneration, and several of them are seeders rather than resprouters; rain-forest trees later move in under the eucalypt canopy, which is not very dense (Tng et al. 2012). <i>Eucalyptus regnans</i> is one of these giant trees and it has a very narrow canopy, much light penetrates it, and there is a well-developed understory.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although Myrtaceae are notably common in terms of numbers of species with stems at least 10 cm across in the Amazonian tree flora, individual species seem never to be locally common (ter Steege et al. 2013). Closely related species of <i>Eugenia</i> from Barro Colorado island, like a number of other taxa that grow in swarms of ecologically similar species in LTRF, show considerable differences in their foliar secondary chemistry, the differences being implicated in defence against herbivores (Sedio et al. 2017).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> The floral diversity of Myrtaceae in Australia is striking, and ca 320 species there may be bird-pollinated, especially by lorikeets (Ford et al. 1979), and these may  eat pollen (Stiles 1981 and references); see Keighery (1982) for pollination of Western Australian species of Myrtaceae. In many Myrtaceae the numerous stamens with their brightly coloured filaments are the visual attractant for the pollinator, and in taxa such as <i>Callistemon</i>, the bottle-brush, the flowers of the one inflorescences all open simultaneously. Many Myrtaceae have such brush-type inflorescences, not that dissimilar functionally from the large polystaminate flowers of <i>Eucalyptus</i> s.l.. <i>Calothamnus</i> has similarly aggregated flowers in which the stamen fascicles form flattened structures, the individual flowers being more or less monosymmetric (Westerkamp &amp; Cla&szlig;en-Bockhoff 2007), while <i>Verticordia</i>  has elaborately-fringed sepals - and sometimes also petals and staminodes. The anther glands (see e.g. Landrum &amp; Bonilla 1996) produce oils which may attract pollinators, but they also help in the attachment of pollen to stylar hairs, as in the secondary pollen presentation devices of <i>Verticordia</i> and a number of other Australian taxa (Howell et al. 1993; Ladd et al. 1999). Most <i>Syzygium</i> and Myrteae are bee-pollinated (Biffin et al. 2010a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fleshy-fruited Myrtaceae are commonly dispersed by bats (Muscarella &amp; Fleming 2008), birds and other animals. They are an important food resource for them in the New World in particular, for instance, in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil Myrtaceae vary considerably both in basic fruit morphology and in fuiting times (Staggemeir et al. 2017). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Staggemeier et al (2015b and references) looked at phenological patterns in Myrtaceae from the Atlantic forest of Brazil.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u>  Myrtoideae are noted for the  amount and diversity of the terpenes that they produce (Keszei et al. 2010), and these compounds were thought to be involved in defence against herbivores (Lawler &amp; Foley 2002). However, they seem rather to be signalling compounds, and a variety of formylated phloroglucinol compounds, for the most part biosynthetically unrelated to terpenes, are actually involved in herbivore deterrence (Moore et al. 2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">About half the galls on Australian plants have been recorded from Myrtaceae (Mani 1964). Thus Eriococcidae (scale insects) are widely distributed on <i>Eucalyptus</i> and other members of the family (Gullan et al. 2005). Another set of galls are found on species of <i>Eucalyptus</i> as well as other unrelated Australian Myrtaceae such as <i>Syzygium</i>, <i>Melaleuca</i> and the like. These genera are part of a three-way mutualistic association that also involves the actual gall-former, a nematode, <i>Fergusobia</i>, as well as  a dipteran, <i>Fergusonina</i>, which the nematode parasitises for part of its life cycle and the larvae of which determine the internal structure of the gall (Taylor et al. 2005; Ye et al. 2007; Nelson et al. 2014). Although the relationship is often 1:1:1, deep cospeciation appears not to be involved, the stem age of Fergusoninidae being around 42 m.y.a., much younger than those of its hosts, however, lower-level cospeciation is possible (Nelson et al. 2014). This is a very interesting tritrophic association, however, little more than its outline is currently understood, and there may be several hundred different fly-nematode associations (Nelson et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Larvae of 90 or more species of pergid sawflies are found on <i>Eucalyptus</i>, far more species than are found on non-myrtaceous/rainforest plants  (Schmidt &amp; Walter 2014). Tortricine moths (Epitymbiini) larvae feed on Myrtaceae leaf litter in Australia, and some other moth groups are also foliovores on this family there (Powell et al. 1999). For the insects that eat <i>Metrosideros</i>, which has quite recently moved to Hawai'i, see Gruner (2004). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u>  Dry-fruited Myrtoideae from Australia, including <i>Melaleuca</i> and <i>Eucalyptus</i>, are often ectomycorrhizal (e.g. Chilvers &amp; Pryor 1965; Smith &amp; Read 1997; Tedersoo et al. 2008; B&acirc; et al. 2011a). ECM fungi from Nothofagaceae and Myrtaceae, both southern groups, are similar, perhaps because ECM fungi moved from Nothofagaceae on to Myrtaceae as the climate became drier in the Tertiary (Tedersoo et al. 2008, 2014a). At least some species of <i>Eucalyptus</i> form both ecto- and endomycorrhizal associations (Adjoud-Sadadou &amp; Halli-Hargas 2000; Kariman et al. 2012). Bacterial mycorrhization helpers are known for both ecto- and endomycorrhizal <i>Eucalyptus</i> (Duponnois &amp; Plenchette 2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Economic Importance.</b> For <i>Eucalyptus</i> s.l., now widely grown for its timber and essential oils, see Coppen (2002).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For polyhydroxyalkaloid distribution (pyrrolizidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine alkaloids), see Porter et al. (2000); they occur both in <i>Psiloxylon</i> and in some Myrtoideae. A number of Myrtoideae produce gums s.l. (these have been called kinos - Lambert et al. 2007b, 2013) and especially terpenes (Keszei et al. 2010), while some have high silica content in their leaves (Westbrook et al. 2009).  Da Silva et al. (2012) noted that there was a diversity of colleter morphologies in the family, although they did not record any colleters from Eucalypteae; see Pimentel et al. (2014) for colleters in the flowers.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Perianth parts of some <i>Eucalyptus</i> relatives may be undifferentiated and/or variously fused (e.g. Drinnan &amp; Ladiges 1989a, b; Bohte &amp; Drinnan 2005); circumscissile abscission of the hypanthium occurs in various ways.  Androecial variation is extreme,
even in quite closely-related taxa. Flowers with apparently oppositisepalous stamens are developmentally derived from an oppositipetalous androecium (see e.g. Carrucan &amp; Drinnan 2000; Drinnan &amp; Carrucan 2005; see also Orlovich et al. 1999 and references for floral development).  Thornhill and Crisp (2012) discuss pollen evolution in the family. Johnson and Briggs (1984) emphasized the fully superior nature of the ovary in Psiloxyloideae (= their Psiloxylaceae), with its relatively narrow base, comparing it with the more or less inferior ovary of Myrtoideae (Myrtaceae), which always had a broad base. Pimentel et al. (2014) suggest that the inferior ovary in Myrteae may be either appendicular or receptacular (also placentae may be cauline or carpellary). There is considerable variation in ovule morphology (Bohte &amp; Drinnan 2005), and the parietal tissue varies greatly in thickness (very thick in <i>Eugenia</i> - see van Wyk &amp; Botha 1984); Corner (1976) described the micropyle as being exostomal; it is variable, but perhaps most commonly bistomal.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Seed coat (see also ovule) and embryo vary greatly, e.g. van Wyk and Botha (1984) and Biffin et al. (2006). Testa
anatomy correlates with fruit type: capsular fruits have exotestal seeds;
baccate fruits have seeds with a generally sclerotic testa. There is commonly a more or less elaborated basal portion of the hypocotyl that bears root hairs, however, in <i>Angophora</i> a broad, disc-like structure there is apparently devoid of such hairs (Baranov 1957).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the phytochemistry of <i>Heteropyxis</i>, see Mohammed et al. (2009); the plant apparently lacks terpenes. Heteropyxideae are perhaps most similar to
Myrtoideae-Leptospermeae; both wood anatomy (e.g. bordered pits) and pollen are
like those of Myrtoideae (Stern &amp; Brizicky 1958). The stamens have separate traces and the androecium shows no signs of
being fasciated.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Schmid (1980) and especially Wilson (2011), for inflorescence structure of Myrtoideae, see Briggs and Johnson (1979), for information on the very large genus <i>Syzygium</i> s.l., see  Parnell et al. (2007) and Soh and Parnell (2011: leaf anatomy), for <i>Heteropyxis</i>, see Van Wyk (in Dahlgren &amp; Van Wyk 1988), for <i>Eucalyptus</i> and immediate relatives, see McKinnon et al. (2008) and Brooker and Nicolle (2013: venation and oil glands), for <i>Eugenia</i>, see van Wyk and Botha (1984: seed coat, etc.) and van Wyk et al. (1980: cork cambium initiation) and other papers by van Wyk and collaborators, for terpenes in Australian Myrtaceae, see Keszei et al. (2008), for lamina anatomy of Brazilian Myrtoideae, see Cardoso et al. (2009), for filament curvature in Myrteae, see Vasconcelos et al. (2015: correlates with major clades), for a comprehensive pollen survey, see Thornhill et al. (2012b and references), and for embryology, in which there is considerable variation, see Mauritzon (1939a: integuments in bitegmic ovules consistently 2 cells across) and Narayanaswami and Roy (1960 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> The limits of major clades (tribes) are similar in Wilson et al. (2005: <i>mat</i>K) and Biffin et al. (2007: ITS), but the relationships between the clades are less so, although they are poorly supported. The capsular-fruited Myrtoideae are paraphyletic (Sytsma et al. 1998; Wilson et al. 2001; Salywon et al. 2002), while fleshy-fruited taxa (Myrteae, = the old Myrtoideae s. str.) are largely
derived and monophyletic, although the large genus <i>Syzygium</i> s.l. represents an independant acquisition of fleshy fruits (see also Johnson &amp; Briggs 1984); for relationships in these plants, see also Biffin et al. (2010a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Vasconcelos et al. (2017) look at relationships within Myrteae, which has around 2,500 species. The tribe includes three major clades, but the relationships between it and its outgroups are unclear as is the position of the New Caledonian <i>Myrtastrum rufopunctatum</i>; the latter could be sister to the  2,499 other species of the tribe (Vasconcelos et al. 2017). For relationships in <i>Myrceugenia</i> and its immediate relatives like <i>Blepharocalyx</i>, etc., see Murillo-A et al. (2012, 2013). Mazine et al. (2014, see also Mazine Capelo et al. 2011) begin the task of disentangling relationships in the largely New World <i>Eugenia</i>; there are two major clades in the genus (see also Bernardini et al. 2014). The fleshy-fruited <i>Myrcia</i> is strongly paraphyletic and forms a large clade with i.a. <i>Calyptranthes</i> (Lucas et al. 2011, also Wilson et al. 2016; Santos et al. 2016; Vasconcelos et al.  2016), while <i>Marlierea</i>, which it also includes, is notably polyphyletic (Staggemeier et al. 2015a). There are 9 usually well-supported major clades within the complex (Lucas et al. 2011; Santos et al. 2017.)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Eugenia</i> (connate cotyledons, especially New World) and <i>Syzygium</i> (free cotyledons, Old World) were confused in the past; the two are not immediately related (see Schmid 1972 for a pre-molecular resolution of the problem). After disentangling the two, the relationships of <i>Syzygium</i> to genera like <i>Acmena</i> had to be worked out (Harrington &amp; Gadek 2004: ?rooting). As Biffin et al. (2006, see also Biffin &amp; Craven 2011) found, <i>Acmena</i> and <i>Waterhousea</i> are in a well supported clade along with <i>Syzygium</i> s. str., while admittedly poorly supported sister clades to this group are also largely made up of <i>Syzygium</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Phylogenetic relationships around the Australian <i>Eucalyptus</i> s.l. are discussed by Parra-O. et al. (2009), Steane et al. (2011), Bayly et al. (2013a: chloroplast genomes), Rutherford et al. (2016), Jones et al. (2016: much low-level hybridization, species polyphyly, etc.), and references. Although Melaleuceae, another predominantly Australian group, are strongly supported as being monophyletic, the three main clades that make it up have high posterior probabilities but only moderate to low bootstrap support; most of the small genera previously recognised in this tribe fall into a single one of these clades, along with a group of species of <i>Melaleuca</i> s. str. (Edwards et al. 2010; see also Brown et al. 2001). See van der Merwe (2005) for relationships in <i>Eugenia</i>, mostly African, de Lange et al. (2010) for a phylogeny of the Antipodean <i>Kunzea</i>, and Wright et al. (2000a) and Pillon et al. (2015) for relationships in the largely East Malesian-Pacific <i>Metrosideros</i>, still poorly understood but which  has been expanded to include erstwhile genera from South America (<i>Tepualia</i>) and New Caledonia.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Myrtaceae s. str. (excluding Psiloxyloideae) were
traditionally divided into Leptospermoideae - leaves spiral to opposite; fruit
dry, dehiscent - and Myrtoideae -
polyhydroxyalkaloids common; leaves opposite; terpenoid-containing glands in
the apex of the connective, stigma dry; fruit fleshy, indehiscent. This distinction is untenable (see above). For a classification of Myrtoideae in which 15 tribes are recognized, see Wilson et al. (2005) and Wilson (2011)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Generic limits in Myrteae are problematic (Lucas et al. 2005, 2007; Wilson 2011). Thus the limits of and infrageneric groupings within <i>Myrcia</i>/<i>Calyptranthes</i> need attention (Lucas et al. 2011; Wilson et al. 2016), <i>Myrcia</i>, paraphyletic, is to be expanded and to include <i>Marlierea</i> and <i>Calyptranthes</i>, genera based on characters of the calyx that have turned out to be homoplastic (Staggemeier et al. 2015a; Vasconcelos et al. 2016). Vasconcelos et al. (2017) make a number of suggestions as to the classification of the tribe.  Biffin et al. (2006; see also Craven 2001; Biffin et al. 2007; Biffin &amp; Craven 2011) suggest that <i>Syzygium</i> should be delimited broadly, at least pending a better understanding of the morphological variation of this clade; an infrageneric classification needed to be put in place, and if some of the groups were difficult to recognise, that of course would be true if <i>Syzygium</i> were split up and they  were recognised as genera; Craven and Biffin (2010) provide an infrageneric classification, although since 80-90% of the species belong to subg. <i>Syzygium</i>, within which relationships are poorly understood, there is still plenty to do! <i>Eucalyptus</i> may be in the process of being dismembered (Parra-O. et al. 2009 and references); for a classification of the eucalypts, see Nicolle <a href="http://www.dn.com.au/Classification-Of-The-Eucalypts.pdf 2015" target="new">(2015)</a>. On the other hand, the limits of <i>Melalauca</i> are being expanded; if genera were segregated they would both be small and undiagnosable, distinctive characters being highly homoplastic in the group (Edwards et al. 2010). Generic limits in Chamelaucieae are in a state of flux (Rye 2015 and references). The limits of Neotropical <i>Eugenia</i> are best expanded (Mazune Capelo et al. 2011 for a summary). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Botanical Trivia.</b> <i>Eucalyptus regnans</i>, the snow gum, is the tallest known angiosperm, although in mass it is much less than <i>Sequoia</i> or <i>Sequoiadendron</i> (Cupressaceae). It may grow up to 101 m (ca 330 feet) tall, however, before the logging of the last century and a half there may have been individuals substantially over 400 feet tall (Carder 1995).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Ages for taxa in the clade ([<i>Medinilla</i> [<i>Rhexia</i> + <i>Tibouchina</i>]]) in Rutschmann et al. (2004) were around 111.7-25.3 m.y., depending on fossil calibration and analytic techniques used.</p>


<ul><li>Melastomataceae-Melastomatoideae are readily recognisable by their opposite,
usually entire, exstipulate leaves with three or more strong veins ascending from at or
near the base; tertiary veins are conspicuous, and run at right angles to the
midrib. Hair types are notably
diverse. The flowers are borne in  branched, terminal inflorescences and have
contorted and often somewhat stridently purple-pink petals; the porose anthers which invert during
development and often have an elaborate, expanded connective, are
distinctive. In old fruits, the walls
often distintegrate, leaving vertical vascular bundles behind. </ul>

<ul><li>Melastomataceae-Olisbeoideae have opposite, entire leaves and swollen
nodes; the venation is variable, but indumentum is absent or consists of
uniseriate hairs. The blade can be minutely punctate when held up to the light, or the surface may be minutely lineate - this is because of the sclereids common in the family (the surface may also dry minutely bumpy).  The inflorescence is fasciculate and the rather small
flowers are often blue (petals, stamens) and have inferior ovaries, but the parts are otherwise free, the calyx is
valvate and there are twice as many stamens as petals; the anthers dehisce by
slits and there are glands on the connectives. Most species are plants of the understory.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Renner et al. (2001, also  Renner &amp; Meyer 2001) thought that there was little substantial diversification within Melastomataceae until ca 30 m.y.a., and movement into Africa occurred still more recently some ca (18-)14(-10) m.y.a.  Morley and Dick (2003), on the other hand, were inclined to think that the broad outlines of diversification in the family could be linked with major tectonic (drift) events, and there was much diversification within the family, including the separation of the African/Malagasy clades, before ca 68 m.y., roughly when Madagascar and India separated. Clearly, these are incompatible scenarios. Renner (2004a, b) again suggested that dispersal, not drift, was more likely, with separate Miocene dispersal events resulting in the species found on Madagascar, for example. Berger et al. (2015) date a shift in speciation rates in the family to after the divergence of Kibessieae, which they date to around 64 m.y.a., and place this in South America.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The North American <i>Rhexia</i> - well, North American now - occurs fossil (as the distinctive seeds) throughout Eurasia in the Caenozoic (Michelangeli et al. 2012 and references), which has important implications both for dating and biogeographical scenarios.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Melastomataceae s.l. are centered in the New World tropics where some 70% of the family is to be found, and there is a fair bit of geographical structuring of the major clades (see Reginato &amp; Michelangeli 2015).  Columbia alone has one third of the species and Brazil one half (Almeda et al. 2009). In Brazil, some 580 species (14% of the whole family), largely in nine major clades, are to be found in the Atlantic Forest (Michelangeli et al. 2015). 200 species of Microlicieae alone have radiated into the fire-prone Cerrado, crown group diversification being dated to ca 10 m.y.a. (Fritsch et al. 2004); other melastomes are also common there, and much diversification in this species-rich habitat began rather later, within the last 5 m.y. (Simon et al. 2009). Nearly all of the ca 215 species of <i>Leandra</i> are from eastern Brazil (Reginato &amp; Michelangeli 2015). B&eacute;cquer-Granados et al. (2008) and Michelangeli et al. (2008b) discuss the complex biogeography of the speciose Antillean melastomes, while Goldenberg et al. (2008) find substantial geographical signal correlating with major clades in <i>Miconia</i> and its relatives - common in the family (e.g. Penneys &amp; Judd 2005; Michelangeli et al. 2008b, 2012, 2013). <i>Memecylon</i> is particularly diverse in Madagascar, where there are large numbers of very localized species and about 140 species overall (Stone 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For floral evolution in <i>Leandra</i>, see Reginato and Michelangeli (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Melastomatoideae are an important component of the understory vegetation of tropical forests, especially in the New World; in Amazonian forests they are represented by a large number of species with stems at least 10 cm across, but none is common (ter Steege et al. 2013); species are also quite often early successional. Woody epiphytes are quite common in Melastomatoideae, for example in the palaeotropical <i>Medinilla</i> (e.g. Benzing 1990), and in the New World are particularly common in montane habitats. New World epiphytic melastomes may have distinctive anatomical traits that can be connected with water stress, but they do not have CAM photosynthesis (Ocampo &amp; Almeida 2013b). Some species are scramblers, whether with hook-shaped roots, or climbing by roots that attach directly to the support; some of the latter taxa have pseudo-2-ranked leaves, one leaf of the pair being much reduced (see Zeigler 1925; Clausing &amp; Renner 2001a; Gamba-Moreno &amp; Almeida 2014 for anisophylly).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The family is overwhelmingly  mesophytic, but most Microlicieae, along with a few other species, are adapted to the seasonally dry and fire-prone Cerrado vegatation of Brazil (Fritsch et al. 2004; Simon et al. 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In Brazil, at least, apomictic species are disproportionally likely to be pioneers or invasives (dos Santos et al. 2012).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u>  Monosymmetry of the flower is most evident
in the androecium, and the stamens, often distinctively different in colour from the petals, may form a serried rank on one side of the
flower. The petals of Melastomatoideae are usually more or less widely spreading, and buzz pollination is common, flowers being visited by females of many species of bees in search of pollen (Renner 1989; Harter et al. 2002). Different species of bees tend to visit different species, although the bees involved are not oligolectic; thus mass-flowering <i>Miconia cinerascens</i> in Brazil is visited by the stingless <i>Melipona</i> (Harter et al. 2002) which also visits other plants. In Brazil, widespread and sometimes very extensive damage to the anthers was caused by pollen-robbing <i>Trigona</i> bees (Renner 1983). Goldenberg et al. (2008) suggest quite complex relationships between anther morphology and pollinator in <i>Miconia</i> and relatives, and in Andean <i>Miconia</i>, not only has there been independent evolution of broader anther pores, but also white anthers (from variously coloured), dioecy, and polysymmetric flowers (Burke et al. 2012). It has been suggested that buzz-pollinated Melastomataceae and their pollinators are trapped on an adaptive peak (Berger et al 2015) - see also Solanaceae, Malpighiaceae - but in terms of allowing overall diversification the trap would seem to be quite pleasant.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some Melastomataceae have nectariferous anther connectives, the nectar exuding through cracks in the tissue or through stomata (<i>Blakea</i>, Penneys &amp; Judd 2013b), or nectar is produced on the corolla (<i>Medinilla</i>), hypanthium, or even on the stigma or on top of the ovary (some  <i>Miconia</i>), and in these cases the contorted petals form a tube and anthers often open by longitudinal slits (although lacking an endothecium?). Here pollination is likely to be by birds and perhaps rodents (Renner 1989; Stein &amp; Tobe 1989; Vogel 1997; Varassin et al. 2007, esp. 2008; Penneys &amp; Judd 2013b). Pollination by tanagers has recently been demonstrated in <i>Axinaea</i> where the birds eat a sucrose-rich appendage on the anthers which also acts as bellows, pollen being puffed out the anther pores and dusting the the bird's head at the same time (Dellinger et al. 2014). <i>Axinaea</i> grows at 1000-3600 m in the Andes, and some other Melastomataceae, mostly from higher altitudes, have also adopted vertebrate pollination and produce nectar as a reward (Varassin et al. 2008;  Dellinger et al. 2014 and references; Brito et al. 2016); this happens in <i>Blakea</i>, and this in conjunction with explosive pollination, pollen being discharged when the anthers are touched (Wester et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In many Olisbeoideae oil is the reward for the pollinator. There genera of Centridini, Exomalopsini, Euglossini and Tetrapedini collect exudate from the oil-producing anther glands, also collecting pollen by buzz pollination. Flowers with these glands (the great majority of species) are blue, rarely yellow, flowers without them are white (Buchmann &amp; Buchmann 1981; Buchmann 1987), however, there is much infraspecific variability in flower colour (Morley 1976).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Apomixis/polyembryony is common in Melastomatoideae from Cerrado and Campo Rupestre vegetation types in Brazil, where it has been found in about one third of the species; apomixis was more common in the widely-distributed species (dos Santos et al. 2012; Rodrigues &amp; Oliveira 2012). In Miconieae, apomictic species were little visited by pollinators (Brito et al. 2016). For apomixis - and also hybridization - in <i>Leandra</i>, see Reginato and Michelangeli (2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Melastomatoideae, capsular fruits are linked with superior ovaries and fleshy fruits with inferior ovaries, although this is not an absolute correlation. Fleshy fruits have arisen more than once, and in both the Old and New Worlds. Throughout the Neotropics fruits of Melastomatoideae are a major resource for frugivorous birds, smaller species in particular (Stone 1981). Thus fleshy fruits of Miconieae in the Colombian Andes comprise about 11.5% by weight of fleshy fruits but ca 32% of all fruit eaten by birds (Kessler-Rios &amp; Kattan 2012). Taxa with fleshy fruits and small seeds are much eaten by tanagers, which, being "mashers", tend to remove seeds more than 2 mm long before swallowing the fruit, while manakins, "gulpers", eat fruits with larger seeds and gulp the fruit whole; both groups of birds are restricted to the New World (Stiles &amp; Rosselli 1993; see also Renner 1986)). The sugar-rich fruits of the largely aseasonally-fruiting Melastomatoideae in the understory of Malesian forests are an important food source for the birds there (Leighton &amp; Leighton 1983), and the Old-World <i>Melastoma</i> has fruits which dehisce to expose mounds of small seeds with fleshy testas that are eaten by birds. Olisbeoideae have fleshy fruits, but with few and larger seeds.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In the New World, taxa with dry fruit tend be commoner at higher altitudes and in savannas and more seasonal forests (Stiles &amp; Rosselli 1993). A few taxa with dry, dehiscent fruits do have inferior ovaries, and there the outer fruit wall may fall away, the fruit proper then functioning as an ordinary capsule (Michelangeli et al. 2008a); a group of these genera form a clade (Michelangeli et al. 2011: they also have stamens opposite the sepals).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Flowers of <i>Miconia</i> sect. <i>Cremanium</i>, whose stomatiferous anthers have broad pores, are visited by a variety of pollinators, and here generalist pollination is derived from more specialized  buzz pollination (Kriebel &amp; Zumbado 2014). Indeed, in Miconieae as a whole generalist pollination, in which flies are involved, has evolved several times from specialist pollination, in which wasps and/or bees alone are involved. In turn generalist pollination is linked with short anthers, large anther aperture, nectar as a reward, altitude, and also with seed size, flowers pollinated by generalists tending to have fruits with fewer, larger seeds (Brito et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> <i>Clidemia heterophylla</i> and species of <i>Tococa</i> like <i>T. guianensis</i> in western Amazonia live in close association with the ant <i>Myrmelachista</i> which creates mono- or oligospecific "devil's gardens" by injecting formic acid into the leaves of the surrounding vegetation, which is thus suppressed (Morawetz et al. 1992; Frederickson et al. 2005; Salas-Lopez et al. 2014). Bacteria livING off colony debris in <i>Tococa</i> may be eaten by rhabditid nematodes that are possibly in turn eaten by the ants (Maschwitz et al. 2016). Petiolar or laminar ant domatia are quite common in Blakeeae and Miconieae; in <i>Maieta guianensis</i> ca 80% of the host plant's nitrogen is derived from the waste deposited by the ant <i>Pheidole minutula</i> that lives in the domatia (Solano &amp; Dejean 2004). Chomicki and Renner (2015: fig. S10) estimate that there may have been eight gains of myrmecophily in Miconieae alone, and almost as many losses.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The roots have anthocyanins. Poay et al. (2011) described galloylated cyanogenic glucosides from <i>Phyllogathis</i>. For wood anatomy, see van Vliet et al. (1981); vessel:ray pits are simple. Within Olisbeoideae, vessel:ray pits are half
bordered, and the rays are 2-5 cells wide and heterocellular, compared to 1(-4) cells wide and homocellular elsewhere in this clade. For foliar sclereids, see Rao (1957, 1983). A survey of nodal anatomy is needed; split laterals are probably quite common (pers. obs., see also R. A. Howard in van Vliet &amp; Baas 1975), and cortical bundles running along the raised angles of the stem are also to be found. In genera like <i>Dissochaeta</i> and <i>Pternandra</i>
there can be prominent interpetiolar flanges even below the leaves, while in <i>Meriania  nobilis</i> the flange forms a large-cup-shaped structure at the node (?anatomy!). Vernation may seem to be
plicate because the secondary veins are so prominent; the
leaves of <i>Mouriri</i> remain folded as they elongate.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Little is known about floral development, although Wanntorp et al. (2011b) studied that of <i>Conostegia</i>, in which there has been increase in floral meristicy, and some other genera; stamen primordia opposite the petals may split. The floral vasculature of <i>Mouriri</i> is distinctive (Morley 1976). Venkatesh (1955) found that the anthers of <i>Memecylon</i> had a normal endothecium, while in those of <i>Mouriri</i> the walls of the cells of the hypodermal layer were thickened all around. In <i>Miconia</i>, at least, the anther epidermis has a thick cuticle, except that in the pore area, which lacks a cuticle (Cortez et al. 2014). Anthers and anther wall development in <i>Miconia</i> are very diverse, some species having bisporangiate anthers, monocot wall development, crystals in the tapetal cells, etc. (Cortez et al. 2015). For the development and anatomy of the fleshy fruit of <i>Miconia</i>, see Cortez and Carmello-Guerreiro (2008). The seed coat may vary considerably, but with little phylogenetic signal (Ocampo &amp; Almeda 2013a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> <i>Mouriri</i> + <i>Memecylon</i> are sister to <i>Pternandra</i>,
in turn sister to the rest of the family in <i>ndh</i>F trees (Renner 1993); Morley (1953,
1976) had early suggested this general relationship. For a molecular phylogeny, see Clausing and Renner (2001: also morphology;  Renner et al. 2001; Renner 2004b). <i>Pternandra</i> is sister to all other Melastomatoideae, Astronieae perhaps next (Clausing &amp; Renner 2001: moderately good support in a 3-gene
analysis; Renner 2004b). However, in  a recent chloroplast genome analysis <i>Henriettea</i> (Henriettieae) was sister to the 15 other Melastomatoideae included, which represented most major clades (Reginato et al. 2016). A clade that included Merianieae and Miconieae was stable, and was sister to clade in which Bertolonieae were sister to a group that included Melastomeae, but further relationships there were not entirely stable (Reginato et al. 2016). These relationships are quite similar to those in Michelangeli et al. (2014) and Oldenberg et al. (2015). However, in the latter in particular Henriettieae associated with Astronieae while the odd genus <i>Rupestrea</i>, there newly described, was strongly supported as being sister to a clade that included Microlicieae, Rhexieae, and Melastomeae, although more detailed relationships in that clade were not well supported (Oldenberg et al. 2015). For the <i>Schwackaea</i>, see Kriebel (2016a). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Olisbeoideae, <i>Spathandra</i> is probably sister to the large, paleotropical <i>Memecylon</i>, although support is weak and it sometimes links with the [<i>Votomita</i> + <i>Mouriri</i>] clade, <i>Lijnedia</i> and <i>Warneckia</i> are successively sister to the whole group, although sometimes the two form a single clade (Stone 2006; Stone &amp; Andreasen 2010). All six morphologically-based genera of Olisbeoideae  have molecular support (Stone 2006). Within <i>Memecylon</i>, the small African subgenus <i>Mouriroidea</i> is sister to the rest (Stone 2014), although branch lengths along the spine of the phylogeny tend to be short.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a phylogeny of the fleshy-fruited, speciose, and paraphyletic Miconieae (Melastomatoideae), see Michelangeli et al. (2004), Martin et al. (2008) and Majure et al. (2015); genera and sections are not monophyletic, in part because of over-reliance on anther morphology for providing characters to delimit taxa (Goldenberg et al. 2008; Burke et al. 2012). Gamba-Moreno and  Almeida (2014) look at relationships in the <i>Octopleura</i> clade here. Judd (1989) and Judd and Skean (1991) provide morphology-based phylogenetic analyses of axillary- and terminal-flowered Miconieae respectively. For relationships in a somewhat expanded <i>Conostegia</i>, see Kriebel et al. (2014: variation in position of major clades, nice morphology, and especially  2016b), and for those in the speciose <i>Leandra</i>, see Reginato and Michelangeli (2015). Generic limits in Merianeae are difficult (Schulman &amp; Hyv&ouml;nen 2003); Michelangeli et al. (2012) looked ar relationships within the New World Melastomateae and Penneys and Judd (2013b) analyzed both molecular and morphological characters in Blakeeae. For the polyphyletic <i>Leandra</i>, see Martin et al. (2008), and for the African-Madagascan <i>Warneckea</i>, see Stone and Andreasen (2010). Recent broad studies in neotropical melastomes provide an inkling of the new relationships (Guimaraes et al. 2010; Penneys &amp; Judd 2010, esp. 2011: 111 morphological characters; Judd et al. 2010).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> The inclusion of Memecylaceae in Melastomataceae was an option in A.P.G. II (2003), and this was formalized in A.P.G. III (2009). Sampling of New World taxa of Melastomatoideae in particular is rapidly being extended and so needed generic and tribal changes are beginning - e.g. Penneys et al. (2010: Henrietteeae), Michelangeli et al. (2011: Cyphostyleae),  Penneys and Judd 2013a (Blakeeae), and Schulman and Hyv&ouml;nen (2003: Merianeae). For genera in  Miconieae, see Goldenberg et al. (2008 and references); Majure et al. (2013) discuss the homoplasy of previously-used "generic" characters and argue for a broadly delimited <i>Miconia</i> (see also Majure et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Renner et al. (2001) thought that the age of this node was only ca 21 m.y. and Tank et al. (2015: Table S2) about 39.8 m.y., while Conti et al. (2002: calibration in part circular, based on drift events) estimated it at 141-106 m.y. ago. The crown group estimate in Moyle  (2004) was (78.6-)68(-57.4) m.y., and that in Morley and Dick (2003) was ca 68 m.y.;  ca 52 m.y. was the estimate in Sytsma et al. (2004) and  (66-)53(-40) m.y. that in Berger et al. (2015). Rutschmann et al. (2004) used a variety of analytic methods, and the ages they obtained spanned almost all others, around (152.6-)109-58.9(-35.9) m. years.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Renner et al. (2001) thought that the dispersal was responsible for the distributions of taxa in this clade, while Conti et al. (2002) thought that many of the distribution patterns reflected vicariance events, specifically continental drift  (see also Morley &amp; Dick 2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Details of internal exine structure of <i>Alzatea</i> are similar to those of some Crypteroniaceae. Laterocytic stomata are known i.a. from <i>Alzatea</i>, <i>Dactylocladus</i>, and <i>Rhynchocalyx</i> (Baranova 1983). For pollen of much of this group, see Muller (1975), for anatomy - very variable - see van Vliet and Baas (1975: detailed comparison within Myrtales), for gross morphology, see van Beusekom-Osinga and van Beusekom (1975), and for perianth morphology, see Sch&ouml;nenberger and von Balthazar  (2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Some of the relationships within this clade are only weakly supported (see Sch&ouml;nenberger &amp; Conti 2003 for phylogeny and floral evolution of the whole group).   </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Van Beusekom-Osinga and van Beusekom (1975) included Alzateaceae and Rhynchocalycaceae in their expanded Crypteroniaceae. However, great expansion was deemed too radical, but Penaeaceae has been moderately broadened to include Oliniaceae and Rhynchocalycaceae (A.P.G. III 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Conti et al. (2002, see also Conti et al. 2004; Rutschmann et al. 2004, esp. 2007) suggested an origin any time from the Early to Late Cretaceous, a later date being favoured (60-45 m.y. in Conti et al. 2002). Again, crown-group estimates in Moyle  (2004) are much younger (48.6-)39(-29.4) m.y., while those in Rutschmann et al. (2004, see also 2007) were 82.6-17.9 m.y..</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The vegetative anatomy of Penaeeae is undistinguished, but their embryo sac is
unique. Nectar is secreted from the base of the hypanthium. Crushed or broken plant parts of Olinieae smell of almonds; they contain the cyanogenic glucoside, prunasin. The ovules have been reported as being apotropous and
ascending (Baillon 1877). The
interpretation of the perianth of <i>Olinia</i> is a matter of some dispute; here I follow Sch&ouml;nenberger and Conti (2003) although the exact nature of the outer whorl of very small appendages is still unclear (described as "?epicalyx" above).
