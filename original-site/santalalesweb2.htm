<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Moore et al. (2010: 95% highest posterior density) suggested ages of  (107-)103(-98) m.y. for this clade, Sun et al. (2013) and age of 115-109 m.y., Z. Wu et al. (2014) an age of about 163 m.y.a., and Naumann et al. (2013) an age of around 109.7 m.y. (but note position of Berberidopsidales - 112.6 m.y.).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although Soltis et al. (2008) give the ages of divergence of a number of branches below asterids, they are based on a topology [Berberidopsidales [[Caryophyllales + Dilleniales], Santalales, asterids]], and the ages of (131-)120, 117(-112) m.y. in Bell et al. (2010) are based on a similar topology. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Prior to the seventh version of this site asterids were part of a major polytomy that included rosids, Berberidopsidales, Santalales, and Caryophyllales. However, the study by Moore et al. (2008, esp. 2010) using whole chloroplast genomes with moderately good sampling bids well to have cleared up this confusion. Nevertheless, the order of branching below the asterids is still somewhat unstable (e.g. Soltis et al. 2011).

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Note:</b>  <b>Boldface</b> denotes possible apomorphies, (....) denotes a feature common in the clade, exact status uncertain, [....] includes explanatory material. Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).</p>	


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Where a number of characters are to be placed on the tree is unclear. Those with an "[E]" after them are found in the first three families below; if these form a single clade, the characterization above will need to be adjusted accordingly.</p> 


 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Caterpillars of some Pieridae-Pierinae-Aporiina, including the large genus <i>Delias</i>, with 165-to 250+ species (all told, ca 440 species recorded, but on only 9+ genera; 2/5 of all host-plant records) and Lycaenidae-Lycaeninae-Iolaini in particular are found on Santalales, and Loranthaceae (especially), Olacaceae, Ximeniaceae (all Lycaeninae in particular), Opiliaceae and Santalaceae-Santaleae, -Visceae, etc., are recorded as hosts (Ehrlich &amp; Raven 1964; Fiedler 1991, 1995, 1996; Congdon &amp; Bampton 2000; Braby 2005, 2006; Burns &amp; Watson 2013). The ancestors of the butterflies seem to have eaten mostly species of Brassicales and their initial santalalean hosts may have been Loranthaceae; there are no reports of pierine caterpillars on free-living Santalales (Braby 2005, 2006; Braby &amp; Trueman 2006; Braby et al. 2006), although given rather few species of such plants, this is not very surprising. Some pieries have  switched feeding plants from the mistletoe to its host (Braby &amp; Trueman 2006). The origin of mistletoe feeding is dated to (57-)50, 42(-38) m.y.a., but  <i>Delias</i> itself diversified  only (29-)25(-23) m.y.a., i.e. butterfly diversification would have had to occur well after the diversification of that of their hosts (Braby 2006 for information). There ia a record of the monogeneric Pieridae-Pseudopontiinae on Opiliaceae (Robinson et al. consulted vii.2015). Interestingly, a number of the adults of these pierines have warning colouration on the undersides of the wings, and some caterpillars also have warning colourations. However, it is unclear what particular compounds the insects might pick up from their santalalean hosts that would discomfit potential predators (Braby &amp; Trueman 2006), although there is movement of alkaloids from host to parasite in both Santalaceae and Loranthaceae (Cabezas et al. 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Little is known about mycorrhizae in Santalales, but the few taxa studied largely lack them (Landis et al. 2002), exceptions being <i>Ongokea</i>, <i>Coula</i> and <i>Strombosia</i> (Mal&eacute;cot 2002 for references); the second two genera are not hemiparasitic. The absence of mycorrhizae, as well as that of root hairs which occurs in some taxa (see below), is probably connected with the adoption of the hemiparasitic habit.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u>The mitochondrial <i>coxII.i3</i> intron is absent in <i>Comandra</i>, the only member of the order to have been sampled. The rate of change in the nuclear 18s rDNA gene has been greatly accelerated, but that in other nuclear protein-coding genes much less so (Su &amp; Hu 2012),</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For the general chemistry of the group, see Kubitzki (2015); for the distribution of the acetyleneic santalbic acid (octadeca-11-<i>trans</i>-en-9-ynoic acid) in this clade, see Aitzetm&uuml;ller (2012); is found in most groups. For (poly)acetylenic and related fatty acids in the seeds, see Badami and Patil (1981).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The absence of root hairs is perhaps unlikely to be a synapomorphy for the whole clade (c.f. Judd &amp; Olmstead 2004), and although there is little information on this feature in Kuijt et al. (2015), they are quite widely present in Santalaceae, at least (Fineran 1963), but I know nothing about root hairs the first seven families below. Vascular pits are notably variously bordered throughout the order (Herendeen et al. 1999b); Carlquist (2006) suggests that non-bordered perforation plates are a possible similarity with Caryophyllales. The foliar vascular bundles may lack
fibers (but c.f. Olacaceae, Loranthaceae, ?some Opiliaceae). Terminal veinlet tracheids and cristarque cells are scattered through the whole group (Baas et al. 1982; Kuijt &amp; Lye 2005). Wax tubules with palmitone as the main wax occur in several members (Ditsch &amp; Barthlott 1997).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The are a number of morphological issues in the clade. First, there has been controversy over the nature of the whorls encircling the flower. What appears to be the outer perianth whorl - often a minute, rim-like structure - has been interpreted as being a "caylculus" of paired and prophyllar/bracteolar origin in a number of Santalales (Wanntorp &amp; Ronse De Craene 2009; Ronse de Craene 2010; Ronse de Craene &amp; Brockington 2013). However, the shift of the bracteoles on to the top of an inferior ovary needs explanation, as does their presence in the terminal flower of a cymule since these would not normally be expected to have any prophylls at all associated directly with them. Finally, in Loranthaceae, a "calyculus" is described in flowers which are also shown as having a prophyll (Wanntorp &amp; Ronse De Craene 2009).  This "calyculus" is a calyx  that, initiated as a ring, may become irregularly lobed as it develops (Suaza Gaviria et al. 2016 and references). That being said, the calyx in <i>Santalum</i> and Loranthaceae like <i>Struthanthus</i> is unusual in that it initially does not completely encircle the flower, there being an interruption on the adaxial side. Furthermore, Johri and Bhatnagar (1971) note that this structure is not regularly lobed and usually lacks a vascular supply, although it is vascularized in <i>Nuytsia</i>, at least. Finally, in Santalaceae like <i>Comandra</i> there is no evidence of any calyx, at least from gross morphology.  It seems best to call any "calyculus", a calyx (see also Kuijt 2013, 2015), and the single perianth whorl of some Santalales represents the corolla of other members (Wanntorp &amp; Ronse De Craene 2009; Ronse de Craene &amp; Brockington 2013; Kuijt 2015), however, at least sometimes its members are reported to have three vascular traces, two coming from commissural bundles (Smith &amp; Smith 1943). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The second issue is the complex embryology in the order, which is first evident in the loss of the integuments and the disappearance of an organized ovule and placental tissue; the number of integuments in "Olacaceae" is unclear (e.g. Johri &amp; Bhatnagar 1960; Maas et al. 1992; Breteler et al. 1996; Mal&eacute;cot 2002; summary in Brown et al. 2010 and references), as well as cotyledon number. Tracheids in the "nucellus" have been reported from some species, as has vascular tissue directly reaching the embryo sac (Werker 1997). Some taxa may have both micropylar endosperm and embryo sac haustoria (Mickesell 1990), and variation in embryo and endosperm development and embryo sac morphology is very considerable (see e.g. Johri &amp; Bhatnagar 1960; Kuijt 2015), and the remarkable embryo sacs growing up the style of Loranthaceae are without parallel elsewhere (see Bachelier &amp; Friedman 2011 for literature).   The vasculature of the inferior ovary of <i>Darbya</i> (= <i>Nestronia</i>, Santalaceae) and other members of the order suggests that they have become inferior by investment of tissue that is axial in origin (Smith &amp; Smith 1942, 1943; Eyde 1975). Tthere may sometimes be two ovules per carpel (see Maas et al. 1992). Further developmental studies are much needed.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Corolla hairs commonly occur in small tufts immediately abaxial to where the stamens are inserted on the petals, as in <i>Strombosia</i> and Santalaceae. The anther wall is monocotyledonous in development in <i>Maburea</i> (Erythropalaceae: see Maas et al. 1992).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Kuijt (2015), the 
<a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/',600,500)">Parasitic Plants website</a> (Nickrent 1998 onwards), and Heide-J&oslash;rgensen (2008), for the first six families in particular, the old Olacaceae, see Reed (1955) and Mal&eacute;cot et al. (2004), both general, Baas et al. (1982: leaf anatomy), Sleumer (1984a: New World taxa, pollen, anatomy, etc., 1984b: Malesian taxa, general), Lobreau-Callen (1980, 1982: pollen). For other information, see Roberston (1982), Barlow
(1997), and Calder and Bernhardt (1983); for chromosome numbers see (Nickrent et al. 2010: supplement).     </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Mal&eacute;cot (2002) analyzed the variation in four genes emphasizing members of the old Olacaceae; he discussed variation of morphological characters in the context of molecular and combined morphological-molecular phylogenies.  A number of clades appear to be fairly well supported. Erythropalaceae s.l., including Strombosiaceae and Coulaceae (Coulaceae were not included in all analyses, and their position was rather labile) are perhaps sister to all other Santalales and are free-living (Mal&eacute;cot 2002). These clades tend to differ in  most probably plesiomorphic features (e.g. life style) from other Santalales (data from Michaud 1966; Mal&eacute;cot 2002; Mal&eacute;cot et al. 2004: a morphological analysis).  However, exactly where they should be placed on the tree still waits for a strongly-supported resolution of relationships within Santalales, indeed, Coulaceae  were not immediately associated with Erythropalaceae and Strombosiaceae in any analyses (Sun et al. 2015). Mal&eacute;cot et al. (2004) found some support for Erythropalaceae, <i>Ximenia</i> plus some other genera, and most of the rest of the old Olacaceae (a very weakly supported clade) as three clades successively sister to the rest of Olacales in a morphological analysis. Mal&eacute;cot and Nickrent (2008) since found that the old Olacaceae formed about eight clades basal to other Santalales, but relationships between these clades were unclear (Nickrent et al. 2010: see the tree below) and remain so in the recent analyses of Sun et al. (2015). Few members of these basal clades were included in Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016), and there was some support for a paraphyletic Santalaceae that included Opiliaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">However, the big picture of relationships between the other hemi-parasitic taxa seems to be stabilizing (see Sun et al. 2015). Within the Loranthaceae et al. clade, Misodendraceae are often sister to [Schoepfiaceae + Loranthaceae], especially in analyses that include many taxa, although when the number of taxa is reduced they may be sister to <i>Schoepfia</i> in particular (Mal&eacute;cot 2002, see also Nickrent
et al. 1998; especially Der &amp; Nickrent 2008; Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2008; Nickrent et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2015: both plastid and non-plastid genes); this topology is followed here. Opiliaceae (one genus) were strongly supported as being sister to a clade [Santalaceae + Viscaceae] in Soltis et al. (2007a; see also Nickrent et al. 2010). Der and Nickrent (2008) found that Santalaceae were polyphyletic, a few genera being placed in Opiliaceae and Schoepfiaceae, while within Santalaceae there are eight well supported clades; for further details of the latter, see that family.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Mystropetalum</i>, <i>Dactylanthus</i>, and <i>Hachettia</i>, three members of Balanophoraceae, formed a clade (100% p.p.) that was sister to a clade made up of <i>Schoepfia</i>, <i>Dendrophthoe</i> and <i>Santalum</i> (almost 100%), the combined group having 100% support (Nickrent et al. 2005). Although Nickrent et al. (2005) suggested that Balanophoraceae were to be placed within Santalales, not sister to them, the former position had very little support. Su and Hu (2008, 2011) analysing variation in B-class floral genes and with a quite good taxon sampling suggested that Balanophoraceae were basal or near basal in the clade since they found the euAP3 homologue in <i>Balanophora</i>, but not in other Santalales. Su and Hu (2012) looked at several mostly nuclear genes; relationships were still not clear, but Balanophoraceae certainly seemed to be outside Santalaceae.  Balanophoraceae are the only holoparasitic Santalales, and being holoparasitic, they lack most or all of the distinctive vegetative and even floral features of the other members, but they do usually have a bisporic embryo sac and a curved embryo sac (e.g. Fagerlind 1945c, d); the first feature might suggest relationships to Loranthaceae in particular. Sun et al. (2015) attempt to clarify the situation in their analyses, which included 11 species of Balanophoraceae and and 186 other Santalales. Balanophoraceae formed two clades in maximum likelihood analyses, one (A) sister to [Loranthaceae [Shoepfiaceae + Misodendraceae]] [Opiliaceae + Santalaceae]], and the other (B) within the first of the subclades, while in strict maximum parsimony analyses both were in the first subclade, perhaps monophyletic, but in a different position within the clade. Branch length of clade A are very long; clade B is made up of the three genera examined by Nickrent et al. (2005). Interestingly, Balanophoraceae have granule-containing tracheidal tissue, known also from Loranthaceae, Opiliaceae, and throughout Santalaceae (and also Orobanchaceae) (Weber 1986). Balanophoraceae are included in Santalales below, but with no particular position (see also Nickrent 2002; Nickrent
&amp; Duff 1996; Barkman et al. 2007). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For additional information on relationships, see Nickrent and Duff (1996) and
Nickrent et al. (1998).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For a classification of all Santalales except Balanophoraceae, see Nickrent et al. (2010). The seven small families for the seven clades of the poorly-supported basal pectinations are recognised pending resolution of relationships there; if any are sister taxa, they will almost certainly be combined; furthermore, if these families were not recognised, the whole order would have to be placed in a single family (c.f. Sun et al. 2015: p. 500). Families within the old Santalaceae are not recognised, despite the inclusion of highly autapomorphic ex-Viscaceae there. Note that the classification of Santalaes in Kuijt (2015) tends to follow morpology in part. Erythropalaceae are not included there at all, although three of the four genera mentioned below are placed in a broadly circumscribed Olacaceae.</p>

<b>Previous Relationships.</b> Santalales have often been compared with Icacinaceae (now known to be polyphyletic). Both have a single-seeded fruits, often small calyx, valvate corolla, etc. (e.g. Takhtajan 1997). However, there is little other evidence for such a relationship; for Icacinaceae, see especially <a href="aquifolialesweb2.htm#Aquifoliales" target="home">Aquifoliales</a> and <a href="icacinalesweb.html#Icacinales" target="home">Icacinales</a>.</p>

A nectary is sometimes present, being described as adnate to the ovary (Sleumer 1984a) or on top of the ovary (Sleumer 1984b; c.f. Nickrent et al. 2010).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Baas et al. (1982: they examined <i>Brachynema ramiflorum</i>) recorded only infrequent and thin-walled sclereids. However, in the material examined here (see below) there were numerous sclereid nests in the cortex, indeed, they sometimes formed an almost a continuous layer outside the pericycle. Furthermore, stem, petiole, and also, judging from the way young leaves had dried, even the midrib have strongly sclerified diaphragms in the pith; the inside of the xylem cylinder was strongly fluted. Sleumer (1984a, q.v. for stamen position, etc.) described the inflorescence as being an ebracteate corymb.  The seed coat is almost obliterated, and it is difficult to make out details of cell walls. Sleumer (1984) described the endosperm as having amylum and fatty substances; the endosperm stains rather weakly for starch, and the cells contain yellowish globules, the "fatty" and "sticky" substances below.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Molecular data place <i>Brachynema</i>, a genus that is so morphologically distinctive that its inclusion in the order was in some doubt (e.g. see versions 7 of this site and earlier), close to <i>Maburea</i>, in Erythropalaceae s. str. (K. Wurdack, pers. comm.; Nickrent et al. 2016; not mentioned by Nickrent et al. 2010). Nodal anatomy and stomatal morphology, at least, are in agreement with this position. Maas et al. (1992) noted the similarity of <i>Maburea</i> and <i>Brachynema</i> in leaf anatomy.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> <i>Brachynema</i> has often been associated with "Olacaceae" s.l. (Santalales), thus Lobreau-Callen (1980)
placed it in Anacoloseae (Aptandraceae) and Baas et al. (1982) placed it with <i>Scorodocarpus</i> (Strombosiaceae) in particular (see also above). It has also been linked with Ebenaceae (Ericales), as by Reed (1955) and others, while in a morphological phylogenetic analysis it appeared close to Symplocaceae (Ericales; Mal&eacute;cot 2002).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Moore et al. (2010: 95% highest posterior density) suggested ages of  (99-)96(-91) m.y. for this clade, 98-75 m.y. is the age in Sun et al. (2013), while around 128 m.y. is the age in Z. Wu et al. (2014).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Santalales are unusual in that this parasitic clade is much more diverse than its free-living sister group, the reverse of the size relationship normal in parasitic:non-parasitic clades, however, most Santalales are only hemiparasitic (Hardy &amp; Cook 2012); Orobanchaceae are another example.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Endress (2011a) thought that the inferior ovary in Santalales might be a key innovation for them. However, it is difficult to assign ovary position to a particular place on the tree. Many taxa in the families above have a superior ovary, and so do, for example, [<i>Exocarpos</i> + <i>Omphalomeria</i>], a "basal clade" in Santalaceae (Der &amp; Nickrent 2005), Loranthaceae are inferior, Schoepfiaceae are half inferior, and more or less superior ovaries are also found in the clade.  Either there are independent origins for the character of inferior ovary, or reversals, or both.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Individual embryo sacs may elongate greatly and approach the apex of the
mamelon or even the stigma at the end of a long style. Haig (1990) suggested that this may represent competition between female gametes given that their normal spatial constraints (i.e., being enclosed in an organised ovule, see below) are absent.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> The plesiomorphic life style in Santalales is to be free-living, and hemiparasitism by attachment to the roots of the host is derived (Mal&eacute;cot 2002; Mal&eacute;cot et al. 2004; Nickrent et al. 2010); for hemiparasitism, see also Fineran (1991). Aerial hemiparasitism has been derived some five times (Nickrent 2002), intermediate taxa being both root and stem parasites (Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2008); photosynthesis in some aerial hemiparasites occurs largely in their stems. Aerial hemiparasites may have a single point of attachment to their host, or roots running over the surface of the bark may form both additional points of attachment and additional plantlets (as in Loranthaceae: Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2006, 2008; Mathiasen et al. 2008: good survey of stem parasites). Some Santalales are largely endophytic, although the part of the plant that is visible is chlorophyllous (Santalaceae, e.g. some species of <i>Viscum</i> and <i>Arceuthobium</i>), while Balanophoraceae are holoparasitic (Nickrent et al. 2005; see also Tesitel 2016). A few Santalaceae in particular are hyperparasites, often parasitizing Loranthaceae, and some species of <i>Phoradendron</i> (Santalaceae) are even obligate parasites on other members of the same genus (Calvin &amp; Wilson 2009; Wilson &amp; Calvin 2016: "epiparasites"). For general information on parasitiism, see Kuijt (2015), for physiological details of parasitism, see Stewart and Press (1990). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Gran(ul)iferous tracheary elements are found in the haustoria of several unrelated members of the clade; the granules are usually proteinaceous, but are made up of starch in <i>Ximenia</i> (Fineran &amp; Ingerfeld 1982).  </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Ovule, embryo sac and embryo development of many plants in this clade are more or less remarkable. Distinct integuments, or even distinct ovules, may not be recognizable, the embryo sacs being borne in a
spherical body, the mamelon; this
may consist of a basal placenta and everything else (see e.g. Paliwal 1956; Ross &amp; Sumner 2005; Brown et al. 2010 for discussion as to what this structure might actually be). Brown et al. (2010) surveyed the distribution of  integument number across the order, and looked at the expression of two genes, one expressed in the integuments in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, at least, and the other in the chalaza; they found that both genes were expressed in the outer layer of ovules in Santalaceae-Santaleae and -Visceae that apparently lacked integuments, the integument(s) having become fused with the nucellus. Individual embryo sacs may elongate greatly, even approaching the stigma at the end of the long style. In some taxa the endosperm surrounding the single developing embryo is a composite affair, representing the products of more than one embryo sac (Fagerlind 1947a, 1948; Maheshwari 1950; Bhatnagar &amp; Johri 1960; Ram 1970; Bhatnagar 1970; Bhandari &amp; Vohra 1983; Johri et al. 1992; Shamrov et al. 2001; Subrahmanyam et al. 2015; Kuijt 2015 and references). Cocucci (1983) outlined variation in ovary morphology and the distribution of starch-containing tissues (primarily in the style or the mamelon); these latter may be involved in the extraordinary growth of the embryo sac. However, more work on embryology and gynoecial morphology is needed.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u>  In ecological literature "mistletoes" uusually implicitly or explicitly include members of Loranthaceae, Santalaceae-Visceae, -Santaleae, Misodendraceae, etc., basically an ecological grouping like "mangroves" (see references in Watson 2001; Ndagurwa et al. 2016). Loranthaceae and Santalaceae in particular can have considerable effects on the communities in which they are found, far beyond any immediate effects they might have on their hosts.  Their fruits may be valuable food resources for specialised frugivores, flowers of the Loranthaceae in particular are important nectar sources, their leaves decay rapidly and affect nutrient cycling in the community, and  they may also provide valuable real estate for nesting birds.</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">The photosynthetic potential of "mistletoes" (here <a href="santalalesweb2.htm#Loranthaceae">Loranthaceae</a> and <a href="santalalesweb2.htm#Santalales">Back to Santalales</a> + Santalaceae-Visceae) may be low relative to that of their hosts, or about the same, and if low on a per unit chlorophyll basis, that may be compensated for by high chlorophyll concentrations. Transpiration rates and timing of stomatal opening may also be of interest, however, records need to be sorted out and assigned to the two clades involved; see Johnson and Choinski (1993) for literature.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant/Animal Interactions.</u> These are still not well understood, but Burns and Watson (2013) emphasized their distinctive nature when they called them "islands in a sea of foliage"; herbivorous arthropods in particular are associated with particular species of mistletoe.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The stems have tranvesely orientated stomata in Visceae and Loranthaceae, at least (Kuijt 1959).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For inflorescence morphology - which can be hideously complex - of this group of families, see Suaza-Gaviria et al. (2017); the main axis seems to be indeterminate, the lateral branches more or less modified cymes with a fair amount of "fusion"/recaulescence, etc.. Suaza-Gaviria et al. (2017) rightly note  that inflorescences here are not racemes.</p>

<ul><li>Loranthaceae are usually stem parasites whose own stems form secondary points of attachment along the host stem. They are recognizable by their more or less opposite,
often rather thick and brittle (especially when dry, but even a fresh leaf crumbles when crushed) leaf blades with entire margins
and inconspicuous venation born on stems that are not jointed. Their usually 4-5-merous flowers are often quite long, narrowly tubular and brightly
colored - often red and/or orange - and lack much in the way of a
calyx; the ovary is inferior and the fruits are fleshy. The
flowers often have a bract/bracteole at the base and immediately to one side
of the ovary.</ul>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The pollen form genus <i>Aquilapollenites</i> is bilaterally symmetrical and with four wing-like projections; it gives its name to the circumboreal <i>Aquilapollenites</i> pollen province.  Although the pollen grains are similar to those of Loranthaceae they are also like those of a number of other families (Farabee  1991); they have not been associated with flowers (Friis et al. 2011 and refences). Otherwise, the first records of the distinctive loranth pollen is from the early Eocene (Manchester et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Loranthaceae are common in Australia and  were, one might have thought, easily dispersed, however, they are unknown from Tasmania (but are found in New Zealand, etc.).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Kuijt (2009b) noted that floral variation in Neotropical Loranthaceae was far greater than in Palaeotropical members. Kuijt (2011) suggested that sessile, axillary, 4-merous flowers were primitive in the family - genera around <i>Phthirusa</i> were examples.</p> 


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u>  The root parasitic habit, as in <i>Nuytsia</i>, is probably the basal condition in the family, since <i>Nuytsia</i> is sister to the rest of the family (Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2005) and the most immediate out groups (but not Misodendraceae) are root parasites. <i>Atkinsonia</i>, from S.E. Australia (which has a vascularized "calyx" - see Johri &amp; Bhatnagar 1972), and <i>Gaiadendron</i>, from Central and South America), are two other root parasitic genera that may also be near the base of the phylogeny (see Reid 1991 for the fruit types of <i>Gaiadendron</i> and <i>Amylotheca</i>). Roots of <i>Phrygilanthus acutifolius</i> are described as growing down from the host into the soil, and thence to trees many metres away, which the plant then parasitizes (Benzing 1990). Hence be careful interpreting the characterisation of "the rest" above (Wilson &amp; Calvin 2006a, b; c.f. Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2008b: support not very strong).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">It is estimated that the stem/branch parasitic habit evolved ca 28-40 m.y.a. (Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2006, 2008a), about when the family started diversifying. The host-parasite junction may be
much swollen, producing wood roses - vascular tissue in the form of variously channeled, split and branched cup-shaped structures - in the host. Morphological details of the association between stem parasite and hosts varies, and the epicortical roots, which may be plesiomorphous in the aerial parasites, form either sympodial or monopodial systems (e.g. Polhill &amp; Weins 1998; Calvin &amp; Wilson 2006; Wilson &amp; Calvin 2006b). Wilson and Calvin (2006a, b) discuss the evolution of the various kinds of host attachments, although given the weak support for relationships at the base of the tree it is premature to worry too much about how many times aerial parasitism has evolved - perhaps only once in the family (Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2008b). Loranthaceae are primarily xylem parasites, but their haustoria may sometimes tap the phloem (Barlow 1997). Some Loranthaceae are hyperparasites, parasitizing other Loranthaceae, while the endophytic <i>Tristerix aphyllus</i> is almost holoparasitic, only the inflorescence appearing on the surface of the cacti it inhabits (Amico et al. 2007; Fisher et al. 2013). See also Kuijt (2015) for further details of parasitism.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Loranthaceae can be keystone resources - and not simply because they provide snacks for elephants (see below).  They are a reliable source of both fruit and nectar for vertebrates, birds in particular, and the dense clumps of stems they form on branches are valued as nest sites by many birds (Watson 2001; Watson &amp; Hering 2012). Fallen leaves, and excreta of organisms associated with the parasite, may enrich soil nutrients in nutrient-poor communities, and increase total biomass, diversity, etc. (Watson 2009; Watson &amp; Hering 2012; Ndagurwa et al. 2016). In Australia, at least, mistletoe diversity in a community is unconnected with its productivity, but host ranges are narrower in less productive (= less diverse) communities (Kavanaugh &amp; Burns 2012). In South Africa it has been suggested that a high nitrogen content of the host, perhaps along with efficent water conductance (which will also facilitate nitrogen acquisition) may positively influence parasitism by mistletoes, which is most frequent on species in mesic savanna communities (Dean et al. 1994). Cryptic species of mistletoe have higher concentrations of nitrogen than do non-cryptic species (Fiedler 1996; Canyon &amp; Hill 1997).  Press and Phoenix (2005) discuss interactions of Loranthaceae with their hosts (see also under Santalaceae-Visceae).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In Australia, the shapes of loranth leaves
and of the eucalyptus host on which they grow are often similar (Barlow &amp; Wiens 1977). Explanations for
this phenomenon, at most uncommon elsewhere, vary. Canyon and Hill (1997: p. 395) examined this phenomenon in detail, concluding "[Our] results contradict, in some crucial aspect, all of the mimicry hypotheses currently on offer", indeed, recent work suggests that mimicry is not involved (Blick et al. 2012). For possible mimicry, see also Alseuosmiaceae and Lardizabalaceae.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Loranthaceae are a major source of nectar and fruit for birds throughout the tropics. There are about 200 species of bird-pollinated Loranthaceae in Africa (Polhill &amp; Wiens 1998), about 70 species in Australia (Barlow 1984), 36 in China (Qiu &amp; Gilbert 2003), 165 in Malesia (Barlow 1998), and 125 in the New World. Most species with large flowers are pollinated by birds, those with small flowers are pollinated by bees, etc. (Suaza-Gaviria et al. 2016). 44 species in two genera of Nectariniidae-Dicaeidae, flowerpeckers, are endemic to the Indo-Australian area, and they are involved in both pollination and seed dispersal of the family there (e.g. Docters van Leeuwen 1954; Reid 1983). In some taxa the flower opens only when pecked by the birds (hence their common name, "flower peckers"); opening is explosive, and the bird gets covered by pollen. Some Loranthaceae are generalists, while in others there is match brtween the shape of the bird's bill and that of the corolla tube (e.g. Feehan 1985). Other very common pollinators in the family are the closely related sunbirds (Nectariniidae-Nectariniini), also Old World, and they in Malesia they pollinate  species whose flowers do not open explosively (Corlett 2004). Sunbirds are the main pollinators of most African Loranthaceae, and Kirkup (1998) provides a detailed study of the variety of floral morphologies involved. In tropical America humming birds are the major pollinators (Kuijt 2015). Vidal-Russell and Nickrent (2008b) discussed the evolution of bird-pollinated flowers in the family, which, they thought, had occurred several times. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The birds that disperse loranthaceous/mistletoe seeds may specialize almost entirely on fruits of this clade, being part of an association that has evolved  six or more times (e.g. McKey 1975; Reid 1991; Restrepo et al. 2002). Defaecation, regurgitation or simply leaving the sticky seed on the branch having removed the flesh are the three common mechanisms of dispersal (Reid 1991: Table 1). The behaviour of the disperser is often very distinctive. Flower peckers, for example, swing their bodies parallel to the branch so the seeds land on the branch - or can be wiped off on the branch (Docters van Leeuwen 1954 in particular), and in Africa  tinkerbirds (barbets) are common mistletoe eaters, and  wipe the seeds on their bills off onto a branch, the seeds being linked in long, dangling strings, "rosaries" (Restrepo 1987), held together by viscin (see also Reid 1983; Godschalk 1983; Polhill &amp; Wiens 1998). In South America friar birds (Euphoniinae, near Fringillidae) commonly eat mistletoe fruits, and they also eat similar fruits from other epiphytic taxa such as Cactaceae (<i>Rhipsalis</i>), Araceae (e.g. <i>Anthurium</i>) and Bromeliaceae-Bromelioideae (Snow 1981; Restrepo 1987; Reid 1991). The seeds may pass through the gut in a mere 20 minutes - some of these birds lack much in the way of a stomach at all (e.g. Reid 1991) - and when they are deposited on a branch, germination is almost immediate. Overall, about 90 species of birds from 10 families are mistletoe specialists, eating fruit of Loranthaceae and some Santalaceae  (see Mathiasen et al. 2008). However, how effective mistletoe specialists are in dispersing seed to <u>uninfected</u> trees has been questioned, more generalist fruit-eaters perhaps being better at this (Watson &amp; Rawsthorne 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Loranthaceae are the major hosts for caterpillars of pierid and lycaenid butterflies (see introduction to Santalales for literature), some other hemiparasitic Santalales also being involved.  Lycaenidae-Iolaini caterpillar preferences show fair agreement with the classification of Pohill (1998), in particular, most Iolaini are found either on tapinanthoid or taxilloid genera, the two main African groups of the family (Congdon &amp; Bampton 2000). Caterpillars of the pierid <i>Delias</i> occur on Malesian Loranthaceae (Docters van Leeuwen 1954) and of <i>Mylothris</i> on African Loranthaceae (Braby 2005).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Elephants like to eat <i>Loranthus</i>, and will knock over <i>Acacia</i> (= <i>Senegalia</i>) trees to get at the plant (White 1983: see also Santalaceae-Visceae); as noted above, the parasites may be quite rich in nitrogen. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Mitochondrial genes from a presumably root-parasitic member of Loranthaceae seem to have been acquired by the fern <i>Botrychium</i>, perhaps via a common mycorrhizal associate (Davis et al. 2005b). However, in general mycorrhizae are not very common in Santalales and if the gene transfer took place in Asia, as Davis et al. (2005b) suggested, the absence of root-parasitic Loranthaceae from that area is notable.</i>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Economic Importance.</b> Mathiasen et al. (2008) provide a list of  Loranthaceae that harm crops - citrus and cocoa are particularly susceptible.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The apex of the pedicel is quite often swollen anfd forms a cupular structure that may be accrescent in fruit (Suaza-Gaviria et al. 2016). The irregularly lobed and rim-like structure on top of the flower, sometimes - but confusingly - called the calyculus, is thought to be of prophyllar origin in <i>Struthanthus</i> and <i>Phthirusa</i>, at least, by Wanntorp and Ronse De Craene (2009) - but it is in fact calycine in origin, and should be called simply the calyx (see above, also Eichler 1868; Suaza-Gaviria et al. 2016). Polysymmetric 6-merous flowers seem to be plesiomorphous in the family (Barlow 1983; Wilson &amp; Calvin 2006; Suaza-Gaviria et al. 2016), but 7- (or 8-)merous flowers occur in <i>Atkinsonia</i> and <i>Notanthera</i> (see below), the stamens being inserted at two levels on the corolla (Kuijt 2010). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For literature about the nature of the mamelon, whether at least part placental or ovular, see e.g. Narayana (1959) and Suaza-Gaviria et al. (2016); it may be vascularized (Narayana 1959: as also in <i>Dendrophthora</i> - Santalaceae-Visceae). The embryo sac in <i>Moquiniella</i> is some 48 mm long, the longest in the angiosperms; it grows up the style and then may grow back downwards after reaching the stigma (this is sometimes called an embryo sac haustorium - see Mikesell 1990), and other members of the family have embryo sacs nearly as long (e.g. Johri &amp; Bhatnagar 1972; Cocucci 1990). In general, after fertilization the
embryo is "planted" back down at the base of the mamelon by the
development of a long, biseriate suspensor. The embryo sac  quite often has a caecum of some sort, e.g., there is a basal caecum in <i>Lysiana</i> and <i>Lepeostegeres</i> (Narayana 1958; Dixit 1959a). The embryos of <i>Helicanthus</i>, <i>Lysiana</i>, and some other genera have multicellular processes at the radicular end (Johri et al. 1957; Narayana 1959). Both Cronquist (1981) and Takhtajan (1997) describe the endosperm as being starchy (see also Dixit 1959a, b), but it is not so scored in Mal&eacute;cot (2002);  the embryo sac may also be full of starch grains. In many Old World Loranthaceae the cotyledons are connate, but not basally; the plumule emerges through the basal slit (Kuijt 1969).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For much information about all aspects of the family, see Johri and Bhatnagar (1972) and Kuijt (2015), for foliar anatomy, see Kuijt and Lye (2005: terminal tracheids),  for growth habits, see Benzing (1990), for floral morphology and embryology, see Robles et al. (2016), for pollen, see Feuer and Kuijt (1985 and references), for embryology, etc., see Narayana (1958, 1959: <i>Nuytsia</i>), Dixit (1959a, b), Raj (1970), Bhatnagar and Johri (1983) and Subrehmanyam et al. (2015), and for seedlings of neotropical Loranthaceae, see Kuijt (1982).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Kuijt (2015) noted that neither embryology nor seedlings of Old Word genera were much known, nor the embryology of New World genera.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Relationships within Loranthaceae are being clarified. <i>Nuytsia</i> is sister to the rest of the family (Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2005). The root parasitic <i>Atkinsonia</i> (S.E. Australia) and <i>Gaiadendron</i> (Central and South America) may also be near the base of the phylogeny (the latter has spherical inaperturate pollen and its fruits are not viscous), although there is rather weak support for the stem parasite <i>Notanthera</i> being sister to all Loranthaceae except <i>Nuytsia</i> (Wilson &amp; Calvin 2006a, b; c.f. Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2008b). Sun et al. (2015) also recovered <i>Nuytsia</i> and <i>Atkinsonia</i> as succesively sister taxa to the rest of the family, but only the first had strong support, and <i>Gaiaodendron</i> again seemed to be in this area.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For an account of <i>Nuytsia</i>, see Hopper (2010); for a monograph of <i>Psittacanthus</i>, see Kuijt (2009a), and for a suprageneric classification of the whole family, see Nickrent et al. (2010); for some generic limits, see Kuijt (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Loranthaceae and Viscaceae  (see Santalaceae below, as Visceae) have often been considered to be close, even being put in a single family, but there are numerous features separating the two; Kuijt (1969), Raj (1970) and Polhill and Wiens (1998) provide useful tables of differences. Thus the viscous covering of the
seeds of loranthaceae is mesocarpial in origin, being outside the vascular bundles and, the fruits of Loranthaceae contain rubber and
are sometimes used as bird lime. Although some Loranthaceae such as <i>Phthirusa</i> have very small flowers and congested inflorescences, they are easily separated from Visceae which also have these features; plants of the latter are often lighter green in color, they lack  roots running over the surface of the host, their flowers are often three merous, and they have green endosperm, etc..</p>

<ul><li>Misodendraceae are dioecious stem parasites (their hosts are Nothofagaceae) that are recognizable by their stems, which are often thick, even when young, "giving the leafy species a rather elephantine appearance" (Kuijt 1969: p. 76). The leaves may be reduced, and in some species those on flowering shoots look very different from those on vegetative shoots. The flowers are small, and the small, nutlike fruits are very distinctive with their three, long, plumose attachments.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Pollen of Misodendraceae has been found in Patagonia in deposits ca 45 m.y.o. (Zamaloa &amp; Fern&aacute;ndez 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u>  Stem parasitism evolved here well before that in Loranthaceae, which occurred some ca 40 m.y.a. (Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2006, 2007).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Seed Dispersal.</u> Seeds are dispersed by wind, unlike those of other mistletoes, or they stick to passing animals (Reid 1991 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The inflorescence may look like a (compound) raceme or spike, but there are clearly cymose units in some species (Suaza Gaviria et al. 2017).  According to Takhtajan (1997) the pollen is colpate.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Kuijt (1969; 2015: in the latter the ovary is described as being superior), for details of wood anatomy, which is rather distinctive, see Carlquist (1985c), for pollen, see Zamaloa and Fern&aacute;ndez (2016 and references), and for seeds and seedlings, see Kuijt (1982: corrections to earlier work).</p>

often two-ranked, lack much in the way of venation, and may have small bumps
because of the cystoliths. The flowers
are small and are borne in inflorescences which are often almost catkin-like
when young; there is only one obvious perianth whorl. The ovary is superior.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Visceae have perhaps been branch parasites for much of the 72 m.y. the clade may have existed (Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2008). The large genus <i>Thesium</i> may be of South African origin and with a stem age of ca 60 m.y. and a crown age of (56.5-)42.7-35.9(-24.4) m.y. (T. E. Moore et al. 2010: a variety of analyses). <i>Santalum</i>, the sandalwood genus, is centred on Australia and the Pacific, and there have perhaps been two migrations from Australia to Hawaii and also two migrations out of Hawaii to the south Pacific (Harbaugh &amp; Baldwin 2007).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The leaves of <i>Viscum crassulae</i> are supposed to mimic those of its preferred host, <i>Portulacaria afra</i> (Didieraceae: ?reference).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> For root parasitism in <i>Santalum album</i>, see Tennakoon and Cameron (2006). The branch-parasitic habit seems to have evolved three times in Santalaceae, in the <i>Viscum</i> (Visceae), <i>Eremolepis</i> (Santaleae) and <i>Dendromyza</i> (Amphorogyneae) groups (Der &amp; Nickrent 2008; Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2008).  Expanded wood roses may be produced by the host at places where the parasite attaches. </p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Press and Phoenix (2005) and Ndagurwa et al. (2016) and references discussed the general ecological effects of the host-parasite interactions of Visceae. Most species of the dwarf mistletoe <i>Arceuthobium</i> parasitize Pinaceae, with a few species also groing on <i>Juniperus</i>, in Cupressaceae (Farjon 2008). <i>Phacellaria</i> (Visceae) is an obligate hyperparasite on a few other Santalaceae (<i>Dendrophtho&euml;</i>) and especially Loranthaceae, <i>Taxillus</i> in particular (Li &amp; Ding 2006; see also Mathiasen et al. 2008), while <i>Phoradendron durangense</i> and <i>P. falcatum</i> parasitize only other species of <i>Phoradendron</i> (Calvin &amp; Wilson 2009). Other hyperparasites are known from Amphorogyneae, notably <i>Phacellaria</i> (Wilson &amp; Calvin 2016). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some species of  <i>Arceuthobium</i> and <i>Viscum</i> are almost holoparasites, being largely endophytic (Nickrent &amp; Garc&iacute;a 2009; Mauseth &amp; Rezaei 2013). The mistletoe <i>Viscum minimum</i>, from the eastern Cape, has aerial stems about 3 mm long  and with but a single internode (Don Kirkup, pers. comm.); these arise from the endophytic portion of the plant (for its growth, see Mauseth &amp; Rezaei 2013). It is also an indicator of elephant grazing,  the animals preferentially eating branches on which it is growing since it is succulent and nutrient-rich (Germishuizen et al. 2007, and references: see also Loranthaceae). In largely endophytic Visceae there is both a phloic and xylary connection between host and parasite, in the  others, the connection is only through the xylem (Tesitel 2016).</b>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> In <i>Santalum</i>, filament hairs are involved in secondary pollen presentation (Howell et al. 1993), while some Visceae are wind pollinated. Three species of <i>Arceuthobium</i> from the Rocky Mountains were visited by 200+ species of insects, although their flowering times were only somewhat overlapping and their major pollinators (up to six) were  also only partly overlapping; pollen was also dispersed by the wind up to 150 m (Penfield et al. 1976).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Many Visceae, and some Amphorogyneae and Santaleae, stem parasites, have fleshy fruits and are dispersed by birds in a fashion rather similar to the fleshy fruits of Loranthaceae, indeed, information about these (and other Santalalean) families is often to be found under the general name, "mistletoes" (Watson 2001). Strings of seeds, "rosaries", from the bird faeces may dangle from the branch (Godschalk 1983; Restrepo 1987: South American species; Reid 1991; see also <a href="santalalesweb2.htm#Loranthaceae">Loranthaceae</a>).  In <i>Arceuthobium</i> seed discharge is explosive, the seed leaving the fruit at about 1370 cm/second and travelling up to 20 meters (66 feet) (Hinds et al. 1963; Hawksworth &amp; Wiens 1996). Although immediately prior to seed discharge fruit temperature increases substantially because of uncoupled respiration, how that increase might effect seed discharge is unclear (deBruyn et al. 2015). For the dispersal of seeds of some Visceae and Santaleae by birds, see Restrepo et al. (2002).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fertilization may be considerably delayed after pollination (Ross &amp; Sumner 2005); the seeds can take two years to mature and the embryo lacks a plumule but has a well developed radicle (Ross Friedman &amp; Sumner 2009). Photosynthesis in the green endosperm of Visceae is described as facilitating germination by providing energy for the establishment of the seedling (Tesitel 2016); green endosperm in also known in the very different <i>Crinum</i> (Amaryllidaceae-Amaryllidoideae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Molecular evolution has greatly speeded up in the <i>Viscum</i> clade (Vidal-Russell &amp; Nickrent 2008). A very large genome with a 2C value of some 205.8 pg or more is found in <i>Viscum</i> alone of Santalales examined (Leich et al. 2005; c.f. Zonneveld 2010), and  the amount of DNA per chromosome is perhaps the highest in all eudicots (Jordan et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Viscum scurruloideum</i>, not a notably reduced species, has a tiny mitochondrial genome (ca 66 kb) with high substitution rates that has lost its respiratory complex I, pratically unique in eukaryotes, yet at the same time it has remarkably large repeat pairs that are practically identical (Skippington et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Economic Importance.</b> Mathiasen et al. (2008) provide a list of  Santalaceae that harm crops and timber trees. Species of <i>Arceuthobium</i> (e.g. <i>A. americanum</i>) in particular are major pests on conifers in west North America in particular, causing extensive witches' brooms and the ultimate death of the host; the amount of timber lost is substantial (e.g. Unger 1992).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Subepidermal cells of the stem divide irregularly, the outer walls being cutinised; this is the cuticular epithelium, and it lacks both suberin (c.f. cork) and lenticels, and there is no cork cambium (Wilson &amp; Calvin 2003).  It is present in Eremolepidaceae (Santaleae) and Visceae, as well as in other Santalaceae; its distrbution needs clarification.  Stomata on the stem and leaf are commonly tranversely oriented (Kuijt 1959: stem; Butterfass 1987). The orientation of cataphylls and their relation to prophylls in genera like <i>Phoradendron</i> as described by Kuit (1996) are unclear. Similarly, the structures called prophylls by Kuijt (2013) and found on vegetative shoots, as in <i>Arceuthobium azoricum</i>, are probably colleters or something similar, since the axillary branches have their first pair of leaves lateral in position (= true prophylls?) in the same plane as these putative prophylls (see also Kuijt 2015: pp. 10-11, esp. Fig. 1d for a discussion).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For inflorescence morphology in Viscoideae, see e.g. Kuijt (1959) and  Suaza Gaviria et al. (2017) and references.  To say that inflorescence vasculature can be difficult to interpret is an understatement, as the illustration of that of <i>Dendrophthora flagelliflorus</i> by Kuijt (1959) suggests, although little work seems to have been done in this area (but see also York 1913). A number of Santalaceae have three traces in their perianth members, the two lateral traces coming from commissural bundles (Smith &amp; Smith 1943), but Viscoideae, for example, have but a single trace, and the stamens may even lack traces (Kuijt 1959).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some Santalaceae have recurrent bundles in the gynoecium, perhaps evidence of receptacular epigyny (Eyde 1975, and references); however, <i>Exocarpus</i> and some other genera have a superior ovary. For information on genes expressed during ovule/embryo sac development, see Brown et al. (2010); in taxa with higly reduced ovules genes normally expressed in integuments are expressed in the tissues immediately surrounding the embryo sac and in the wall surrounding the loculus. Ross and Sumner (2005: <i>Arceuthobium</i>) and York (1913: <i>Dendrophthora</i>) describe the antipodal end of the embryo sac as being apical on the mamelon, while Zaki and Kuijt (1994: <i>Viscum</i>) show it as being basal; there seems to be variation here (see also Rutishauser 1935).  York (1913) even described the chalazal ends of the two embryo sacs of <i>Dendrophthora</i> as fusing. <i>Antidaphne</i> seems to have three vascular traces in its cotyledons. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">See Stauffer (1969) for Amphorogyneae, Solms-Laubach (1867) and Benzing (1990) for haustorial anatomy, growth, etc., of stem parasitic Santalaceae, Hawksworth and Weins (1996) for <i>Arceuthobium</i>, Norverto (2004, 2011) for wood anatomy, Wilson and Calvin (2003) for some aspects of anatomy, Feuer and Kuijt (1985 and references) for pollen, Steindl (1935), Rutishauser (1937), Ram (1957: <i>Comandra</i>), Bhandari and Vohra (1983) and Zaki and Kuijt (1995) and references for embryology, about which there is quite a bit of information, especially for Viscoideae, Leins (2000) for floral morphology of <i>Viscum</i>, Ronse de Craene and Brockington (2013) for flowers of <i>Colpoon</i> and Wiens and Barlow
(1971) for cytology. For a monograph of <i>Phoradendron</i>, see Kuijt (2003).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Der and Nickrent (2005, esp. 2008; see also Nickrent et al. 1998) found seven well supported clades in Santalaceae (see the groups above), but relationships between these clades are poorly understood; there may be a clade including most of the family except the <i>Cervantesia</i>, <i>Thesium</i> and <i>Comandra</i> clades. There is very slight support for a [Cervantesieae + Thesieae] clade, and some support for a [Amphorogyneae + Visceae] clade, etc.; the last clade appeared in both plastid and non-plastid analyses in Sun et al. (2015), but again, other relationships were unclear. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Genera of Eremolepidaceae have very often been kept separate before, but they are well embedded in the <i>Santalum</i> clade (Der &amp; Nickrent 2008), their strongly supported relationships being  [<i>Antidapne</i> [<i>Lepidoceras</i> + <i>Eubrachion</i>]].</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">See Nickrent et al. (2004b: ?rooting) for a relationships in <i>Arceuthobium</i>, Nickrent et al. (2008), Moore et al. (2010) and Nickrent and Garc&iacute;a (2015) for those within the large genus <i>Thesium</i>, and Harbaugh and Baldwin (2007) for the phylogeny of <i>Santalum</i>, the sandalwood genus. Ashworth (2016) examined relationships in Phoradendreae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Two groups, both stem parasites, are morphologically rather distinctive:</p>

<ul><li>1. Visceae. Characters with &deg; after them in the characterization above differentiate Visceae from Loranthaceae; the two are neither close nor morphologically very similar beyond superficialities, although they are chemically quite similar (Kubitzki 2015).  The development of the ovule and embryo of Visceae is  noteworthy, e.g., there is no suspensor (Ross &amp; Sumner 2005; Friedman &amp; Sumner 2009 and references).</ul></li>

<ul><li>2. Ex-Eremolepidaceae. They have a cuticular epithelium, their stem stomata are transversely arranged and their leaves are spiral. The inflorescence is catkin-like and the pollen is spherical; the seeds have a viscous covering that is more or less complete, and some have green endosperm.  In growth they are rather like <i>Notanthera</i>
(Loranthaceae).</ul></li>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Der and Nickrent (2005) proposed that all major clades in Santalaceae should be recognized as families; the seven families listed there are the necessary result if Viscaceae are kept separate (see especially Nickrent et al. 2010; also Sun et al. 2015); apart from Visceae and Amphorogyneae, distinctive features for the clades are elusive. Much of the character hierarchy above is rather notional, given the uncertainty of relationships within the family. For the circumscription of <i>Thesium</i>  see Moore et al. (2010) and Nickrent and Garc&iacute;a (2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Botanical Trivia.</b> <i>Viscum crassulae</i> is a pleasing horticultural subject with its bright red fruits; it must be about the only stem parasite so grown.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Naumann et al. (2013) estimated the  age of a clade [Balanophoraceae [Loranthaceae + Schoepfiaceae]], the only Santalales in the study, at ca 92.5 m.y. (the ages in Table 2 are for a different node); given the findings of Su et al. (2015), this clade, or something similar, may hold. The node [[Loranthaceae [Misodendraceae + Schoepfiaceae]] [Opiliaceae +
Santalaceae]] has been dated to (102-)97, 85(-80) m.y. by Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2001), (115-)99, 91(-76) m.y.  by Bell et al. (2010) and  ca  90.6 m.y. by Magall&oacute;n and Castillo (2009).</p>

<ul><li>Balanophoraceae are echlorophyllous yellow to red or brown root parasites whose aerial stem arises from a collar-like structure borne at ground level. The dense inflorescence is racemose, bearing many minute flowers either on the main axis or on compact branches.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> How the host is infected varies. <i>Balanophora abbreviata</i> attaches to the host by sticky endosperm tubules, tubular embryonal primary haustorium processes then infecting the host (Arekal &amp; Shivamurthy 1976); the process looks like infection by a T4 phage. Holzapfel (2001) recorded a radicle in <i>Dactylanthus taylori</i> that attached to the host by epidermal hairs.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Birds, including flightless parrots on New Zealand, small mammals and insects have been recorded visiting the flowers, and the nectar can be quite copious (Santos et al. 2016 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> The mitochondrial genes <i>cox</i>1, <i>atp</i>1 and <i>mat</i>R of <i>Ombrophytum</i> showed massive divergence (Barkman et al. 2007). Recently it has been found that there has been very extensive movement of host (Fabaceae-the mimosoid clade) mitochondrial genes into <i>Lophophytum mirabile</i>, the mimosoid genes replacing the parasite genes and apparently remaining functional (Sanchez-Puerta et al. 2017). There was also some chloroplast and nuclear DNA in the mitochodria, nearly all from mimosoids.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Langsdorffia</i>, <i>Thonningia</i> and <i>Balanophora</i> have balanophorin, a wax-like substance, rather than
starch as the main reserve. Weber (1986) noted several distinctive aspects of gross morphology and detailed anatomy of the haustoria of <i>Mystropetalon</i> such as runners that produced additional haustoria and graniferous tracheary cells in these haustoria that were similar to comparable structures in Santalales, however, graniferous cells occur in other root parasites including Krameriaceae and Orobanchaceae (Fineran &amp; Ingerfeld 1982). For the development of the short, see Shivamurthy et al. (1981), and for anatomy of the vegetative body, see Gonzalez and Mauseth (2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">It can be very difficult to understand the morphology of the flower, the number of stamens, whether the ovary is superior or inferior, the curvature of the embryo sac, etc., although there are a fair number of detailed early studies on individual species of the family.
The florally relatively unspecialized <i>Mystropetalon</i> has a clearly inferior ovary and cuboid pollen with pores at the eight corners; variously angled pollen is known from other Santalales.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Eberwein et al. (2009)  note that the carpellate flowers of <i>Balanophora</i> may entirely lack any appendages and be adnate to clavate bodies, perhaps modified bracts, that are borne in no particular order in the inflorecence. Given the extreme reduction of the flower, the basic morphology of the ovule,
fruit, etc., become unclear. For
cautionary comments on attempts to determine ovule type and orientation in the
family, see Holzappel (2001). Thus Fagerlind (e.g. 1945c) notes that the "apical" cell of the megaspore tetrad in <i>Langsdorffia</i> develops into the embryo sac, but determination of what is apex and base is impossible. Embryo sac development varies, and in <i>Balanophora</i>, <i>Lophophytum</i> and <i>Langsdorffia</i>, at least, there is a chalazal caecum, as in many other Santalales, but such a caecum is weakly developed in <i>Dactylanthus</i> and absent in <i>Corynaea</i> (Johri et al. 1992; Holzapfel 2001; Sato &amp; Gonzalez 2016). Holzapfel (2001) noted
a pseudoendothelium was quite common in the family. <i>Dactylanthus</i> lacks any seed coat. Endosperm development is sometimes categorized as "helobial". The basal cell produced
by the first division of the endosperm nucleus is massive and the nucleus usually remains undivided (if it does, cell walls do not form - Ernst 1914); it is perhaps to be
compared with the chalazal haustorium in other Santalales. Dahlgren (1923) called the endosperm cellular. Division of the smaller upper cell and its descendants always involves the formation of cell walls (see also Ekambaram &amp; Panje 1935). In <i>Helosis</i> the
inner layer of cells  of the seed coat is massively thickened on the inner and anticlinal walls,
while in <i>Balanophora</i> it is the outer layer that is thickened; taxa like <i>Hachettia</i>
are more complex.  </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Takhtajan (1988, 1997) provides
much information under the segregate families mentioned below, as do Hooker (1859) and Hansen (2015), but under the one family; see also Solms-Laubach (1867) for haustorial anatomy, Harms
(1935b), Fagerlind (1938a, 1945b, c, d) and Sato and Gonzalez (2013), all embryogeny, and Kuijt (1969), the <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/',600,500)">Parasitic Plants website</a> (Nickrent 1998 onwards) and Heide-J&oslash;rgensen (2008), all general. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> A family phylogeny (Nickrent 1998: accessed 16.5.2009) based on nuclear SSU rDNA data suggest that [<i>Mystropetalon</i> [<i>Dactylanthus</i> + <i>Hachettea</i>]] are sister to a clade containing the rest of the family examined; see also Su et al. (2012: unrooted tree).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Cronquist (1968) thought that Balanophoraceae (including Cynomoriaceae, here Saxifragales) and Santalales were related, and later (Cronquist 1981) he placed them all in Santalales. Takhtajan (1997) linked Balanophoraceae with Cynomoriaceae, Rafflesiales (here Malpighiales) and Hydnoraceae (here Piperales), including them all in his Magnoliidae; within Balanophorales he included all the families in synonymy below (apart from Hachetteaceae) as separate families.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Sun et al. 2015) recognised a clade that includes <i>Mystropetalum</i>, <i>Dactylanthus</i>, and <i>Hachettia</i> as Mystropetalaceae, the other genera remained in Balanophoraceae s. str., and whether families or not, the two groups need to be split out.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Botanical Trivia.</b> <i>Balanophora</i> has the smallest flowers of any angiosperm; female flowers may have a mere 50 cells in total.</p>
