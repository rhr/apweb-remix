(2010) an age of (97-)92, 89(-88) m. years. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Note:</b>  <b>Boldface</b> denotes possible apomorphies, (....) denotes a feature common in the clade, exact status uncertain, [....] includes explanatory material. Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).</p>	



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The order contains ca 7.8% eudicot diversity (Magall&oacute;n et al. 1999).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">When the phylogeny of the group was considered to be rather like a starburst (see also below), the separation into the 15 or more clades that were then recognised, including individual families like Pandaceae, Caryocaraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Ochnaceae s.l., 
and Humiriaceae, was thought to have happened very rapidly in the late Aptian (Cretaceous), about 114-101 m.y.a. (Davis et al. 2005a). Even with younger estimates for the age of the order, stem groups of most families were thought to have evolved by the end of the Cretaceous (Wikstr&ouml;m et al. 2001).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Diversification rates in the order are thought to have been moderately high (Magall&oacute;n &amp; Castillo 2009). Xi et al. (2012b: see different methods of analysis) examined diversification rates throughout the clade, and found about eight clades in which the rates of diversification decelerated and about five in which they accelerated; these are mentioned individually below.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Endress et al. (2013; see also Xi et al. 2012b in part) summarized floral variation in the order and found features potentially characterising most of the suprafamilial clades. Three-carpellate gynoecia occur in many families, articulated pedicels are also frequent, while paracytic stomata may characterise a sizeable clade here.  Tokuoka and Tobe (2006) integrate testa anatomy and embryology with phylogeny. See also Kubitzki (2013a) for comments. Furness (2011) looked at pollen development, focusing on the parietal-placentation clade; the massive amount of detail that she found is difficult to optimize on a tree, partly at least because of the sampling.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Malpighiales are particularly important in tropical rainforests where they are a major component of the diversity, especially of the woody understory; they account for up to some 28% of the species and 38% of the total stems there (Davis et al. 2005a); members of <a href="ericalesweb.htm#Ericales" target="home">Ericales</a>, especially families like Sapotaceae and Lecythidaceae, are another major component of this vegetation. There are 10 families of Malpighiales with one or more species  of the 227 species that make up half of all the trees with a d.b.h. 10 cm or more in Amazonian forests (for a total of 43 species, i.e. about 20% - ter Steege et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Cretaceous diversification times for many of the clades in Malpighiales suggest that tropical rainforest was developing then (see also Kubitzki 2013a; <a href="malpighialesweb.htm#Rafflesiaceae" target="home">Rafflesiaceae</a>,  <a href="dioscorealesweb.htm#BurDio" target="home">Thismiaceae</a>). However, other evidence suggests that such forest may not have developed until early in the Caenozoic (Burnham &amp; Johnson 2004, see <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#Caenozoic">Caenozoic Diversification</a>), somewhat at odds with the dates just mentioned.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Caterpillars of outgroups to Nymphalidae-Nymphalinae and -Melitaeini, etc., are quite common on Mapighiales, especialy on families like Violaceae and relatives, Euphorbiaceae, etc. (Nylin &amp; Wahlberg 2008; Nylin et al. 2013). The butterfly <i>Cymotho&euml;</i>, with about 75 species, has
hosts widely scattered in this order (Ackery 1988), although also found on Bignoniaceae (one species) and Rhamnaceae (sometimes another species). <i>Phyllonorycter</i> leaf-mining moths (Lepidoptera-Gracillariidae-Phyllocnistinae), with some 260 species and relatively common in more temperate regions, seem to have diversified on this clade (and especially Fagales) some time in the region of 50.8-27.3 m.y.a., well after the Malpighiales diversified, and after the genus itself evolved, some 76.3-50.3 m.y.a. (Lopez-Vaamonde et al. 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">About a quarter of all records of extra-floral nectaries come from Malpighiales (Weber &amp; Keeler 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> The intron in the <i>atp</i>F gene has been lost several times in Malpighiales, alone among angiosperms, however, this varies within Euphorbiaceae, Phyllanthaceae, and Picrodendraceae (Daniell et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Malpighiales may have closed root apical meristems (Clowes 2000), but the sampling is poor.</p>

Endress and Matthews (2006b) discuss petal appendages, etc., in the order. Tobe and Raven (2011: see also supplement) provide an invaluable summary of embryological data for the whole order although, as they note, many families are poorly known; they plot the distribution of some characters of embryology and seed on a phylogenetic tree, much of which is unresolved. Endress et al. (2013) summarized the extensive and detailed morphological work that he and his collaborators have carried out on members of the order over the last twenty years and that of other workers; they emphasized that in 13 families (almost 1/3 of the families they recognized) ovules, etc., were largely unknown. For more on pollen morphology and development, still quite poorly known, see Furness (2012, 2013b). Oginuma and Tobe (2010) provide the first chromosome counts for four families in the order.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><a name="Malpighialesrel"><b>Phylogeny.</b></a> Although Malpighiales are now strongly supported as being monophyletic (e.g. Davis et al. 2005a; Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009; Xi et al. 2012b), relationships within them were initially poorly understood (e.g. Soltis et al. 2007a). Studies suggested relationships within particular clades of Malpighiales, e.g. Litt and Chase (1999), Schwarzbach and Ricklefs (2000), Chase et al. (2002), and Davis and Chase (2004), and these were in general agreement with relationships apparent in broader studies. The distinctive Lophopyxidaceae were
placed close to Pandaceae (represented by <i>Microdesmis</i>) by Savolainen et
al. (2000a; see also Chase et al. 2002); that relationship has held. Davis et al. (2005a) clarified some relationships in Malpighiales in a four-gene (all three compartments) analysis, in particular suggesting an association between the families with parietal placentation (and also Goupiaceae), and also that <i>Centroplacus</i> (ex Euphorbiaceae s.l./Pandaceae) should be recognised as a separate family, perhaps sister to Ctenolophonaceae - support was weak (see also Korotkova et al. 2009 and Soltis et al. 2011 for relationships in Malpighiales). Indeed, in a molecular study by Wurdack et al. (2004) <i>Centroplacus</i> had been associated with Pandaceae, although with very little support. However, Ctenolophonaceae were linked with Erythroxylaceae and Rhizophoraceae, while <i>Bhesa</i>, ex Celastraceae, which L.-B. Zhang and Simmons (2006) found fell among the few Malpighiales they included in their analysis of Celastrales, linked with Centroplacaceae, etc. (Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009). A [Balanopaceae
[[Trigoniaceae + Dichapetalaceae] [Chrysobalanaceae + Euphroniaceae]]] clade had strong support, e.g. Davis et al. (2005a), Tokuoka and Tobe (2006) and Korotkova et al. (2009). Linaceae had been weakly associated with Picrodendraceae in Chase et al. (2002a), but with Irvingiaceae in Tokuoka and Tobe (2006). It had been suggested that Malpighiaceae were rather weakly associated with Peridiscaceae and were perhaps near Clusiaceae et al. (Chase et al. 2002); for the current position of Peridiscaceae, here in Saxifragales, see e.g. Davis and Chase (2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Determining the phylogenetic relationships of Rafflesiaceae has been difficult. Apart from the distinctive and often hard-to-interpret morphologies of Cytinaceae, Apodanthaceae and Mitrastemonaceae, families often associated with Rafflesiaceae, molecular analyses have been problematic in part because of the very long branches in some genes and the general problem of obtaining suitable sequences from holoparasites (e.g. see results from analysing sequences of the mitochondrial <i>atp</i>1 gene - Nickrent et al. 2004a).  Indeed, when representatives of all four families were in the same analysis, an apparently monophyletic Rafflesiales could be recovered (Nickrent et al. 2004a). Nickrent (2002) had suggested that Rafflesiaceae themselves might be close to Malvales, however, other analyses, including those in which not all the erstwhile Rafflesiales were included together, suggested a break-up of the group (see also Barkman et al. 2004; Davis &amp; Wurdack 2004; Nickrent et al. 2004a; Davis et al. 2007; Filipowicz &amp; Renner 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Rafflesiaceae s. str. are now firmly placed in Malpighiales. Barkman et al. (2004a) sequenced the mitochondrial gene, <i>mat</i>R, of <i>Rafflesia</i> and found a strong association with Malpighiales (see below for previous placements of Rafflesiaceae). Although sampling within Malpighiales (only three taxa with parietal placentation were studied) and other rosids was poor, Barkman et al. (2004) noted that the flowers of <i>Rafflesia</i> could be interpreted as having a number of features in common with those of Passifloraceae, including a corona (called a diaphragm by students of Rafflesiaceae), androgynophore, parietal placentation (but this is common in echlorophyllous parasites), etc., but as Nickrent et al. (2004a) pointed out, the "homology" of these structures needs careful examination. Davis and Wurdack (2004: two nuclear, one mitochondrial [<i>mat</i>R] genes), with considerably more extensive sampling, confirmed the inclusion of Rafflesiaceae in Malpighiales, favouring a position closer to Ochnaceae, Clusiaceae and their relatives. Although tenuinucellate ovules are common there, too, it is quite common for holoparasitic taxa to lack parietal tissue in their ovules.  A position of Rafflesiaceae in or near Malpighiales was common in the analyses described by Nickrent et al. (2004a). Most recently, Davis et al. (2007), using largely mitochondrial genes, exemplars of all families of Malpighiales, three of the four genera of Peraceae, <i>Chaetocarpus</i> only excluded, and several Euphorbiaceae, including Cheilosioideae, placed Rafflesiaceae within Euphorbiaceae and with quite good support (see also Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009). In a wrinkle on this association of Rafflesiaceae wiht Euphorbiaceae, M. Sun et al. (2016) found Rafflesiaceae to be sister to <i>Neoscortechinia</i> and <i>Cheilosa</i>, here sister to the rest of Euphorbiaceae s. str., all other members of the latter family being sister to the combined clade, while Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016: sampling, low support) obtained the relationships [Rafflesiaceae [Peraceae + Euphorbiaceae]].</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some families have been particularly peripatetic.  <i>Irvingia</i>
was sister to <i>Erythroxylum</i> in a tree presented by Fernando et al. (1995), and
the stipules of Irvingiaceae, Erthroxylaceae and Ixonanthaceae
are indeed similar (Weberling et al. 1980). However, Irvingiaceae were weakly associated with Putranjivaceae in Chase et al (2002a) and with Linaceae (close) in Davis et al. (2005a). See Clade 2 below for current ideas of the relationships of <i>Irvingia</i>.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Even in 2011 there were still nine clades composed of two or more families in Malpighiales along with seven separate families that together formed a very substantial polytomy (Davis et al. 2005a; Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009; Xi et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). However, relationships in Xi et al. (2012b) are much more resolved.  The major analysis in this study used 78 protein-coding plastome genes and four ribosomal genes; families not included were Lophopyxidaceae, Malesherbiaceae and Rafflesiaceae (the last-named for obvious reasons). Other analyses had included many more taxa but less complete sampling of genes (see Xi et al. 2012b for details).  M. Sun et al. (2016) and Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016) recover little in the way of major groupings within Malpighiales</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Malpighiales can now be divided into three main clades, the Salicaceae-Euphorbiaceae, Rhizophoraceae-Clusiaceae, and  Malpighiaceae-Chrysobalanaceae clades (clades 1, 2 and 3 below), all with substantial molecular support (>80% ML bootstrap, 1.0 p.p.) and even with a modicum of morphological support. Although at the next level of the tree the clades 2 and 3 have polytomies and clade 1 an only weakly-supported dichotomy, overall the improvement of resolution in the tree is substantial (Xi et al. 2012b), and the relationships suggested  there are followed here.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Clade 1. [[Humiriaceae [Achariaceae [[Goupiaceae + Violaceae] [Passifloraceae [Lacistemataceae + Salicaceae]]]] [[Peraceae [Rafflesiaceae + Euphorbiaceae]] [[Phyllanthaceae + Picrodendraceae] [Linaceae + Ixonanthaceae]]]].</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">This is the one clade that was for the most part recovered by Sun et al. (2016). Although support for the [Humiriaceae [Achariaceae [[Goupiaceae + Violaceae] [Passifloraceae [Lacistemataceae + Salicaceae]]] clade is not strong (Xi et al. 2012b), the part of this clade excluding Humiriaceae (= the parietal clade) has very strong support. Goupiaceae are certainly to be included here, although their association with Violaceae is only weakly supported, as is the position of the combined clade; major relationships in the rest of this clade have strong support (Xi et al. 2012b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Molecular evidence that a group  of families with parietal placentation and (often) three carpels was monophyletic had initially not been compelling (e.g.
see Savolainen et al. 2000a; Chase et al. 2002), although part of the <i>rpS</i> 16 gene is absent from Passifloraceae-Passifloroideae and -Turneroideae,  Violaceae, and Salicaceae s. str. (and also Linaceae and Malpighiaceae, so really a feature of Malpighiales?: see Downie &amp; Palmer 1992). Salicaceae were weakly associated with Passifloraceae, and in turn with Humiriaceae and Pandaceae, and Violaceae were weakly associated with Achariaceae (and Goupiaceae, Lacistemataceae and Ctenolophonaceae) in Chase et al (2002). Tokuoka and Tobe (2006) found a weakly-supported relationship between the Passifloraceae group and Violaceae (see also Soltis et al. 2007a), and strongly supported relationships between Lacistemataceae and Salicaceae. However, Davis et al. (2005a) found a poorly/moderately supported association of these taxa with parietal placentation (59% bootstrap, 1.00 posterior probability), and also Goupiaceae, with axile placentation, and a similar grouping is also evident in e.g. Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2001), Wurdack and Davis (2009), Korotkova et al. (2009: 83% jacknife, 1.00 pp, Goupiaceae not included), Soltis et al. (2011: details of relationships unclear) and Sun et al. (2016). <i>Ixonanthes</i> was rather surprisingly embedded in Achariaceae in the Bayesian analysis of Soltis et al. (2007a), but that was  due to misidentification of the material, which was a species of <i>Hydnocarpus</i> (K. Wurdack, pers. comm.). </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Indeed, classical morphological studies had suggesed a group that included Salicaceae, Achariaceae and Violaceae, Flacourtiaceae, and Passifloraceae and its segregates, Malesherbiaceae and Turneraceae, in part because of their common possession of parietal placentation, some sort of corona or scales in the flower, nectaries outside the stamens, etc. (e.g. Cronquist 1981). However, a number of other families now known to be quite unrelated, some now in Cucurbitales, were also included. Interestingly, species of the old Flacourtiaceae had one of two kinds of
seed coat: the exotegmen was either more or less fibrous - taxa with this kind of exotegmen are now mostly in Salicaceae - or massive and non-fibrous - taxa with this exotegmen are now in Achariaceae (Corner 1976).  It was also commonly recognized that Salicaceae were simply an extreme morphology reflecting the wind pollination common in that family, and that they  could be linked with some of the old Flacourtiaceae. Distinctive cyclopentenoid cyanogenic
glucosides and/or cyclopentenyl fatty acids, including gynocardin, also occur sporadically here (Webber &amp; Miller 2008). The inclusion of Goupiaceae in this clade is the only real surprise since it is morphologically rather distinct. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The other weakly supported clade in Clade 1 is [[Peraceae [Rafflesiaceae + Euphorbiaceae]] [[Phyllanthaceae + Picrodendraceae] [Linaceae + Ixonanthaceae]]]], the euphorbioids. This is an unexpected clade in that the fruits of a rather broadly delimited Euphorbiaceae (inc. both Phyllanthaceae and
Putranjivaceae) are very distinctive, with the walls falling away leaving the persistent columella, and that was one of the main characters that I use to recognize herbarium material of the extended family. It is hardly surprising that Merino Sutter and Endress (1995) argued for a broad circumscription of the family. However, the clade [[Phyllanthaceae + Picrodendraceae] [Linaceae + Ixonanthaceae]] is strongly supported, as is the [Peraceae [Rafflesiaceae + Euphorbiaceae]] clade (Xi et al. 2012b). The inclusion of Rafflesiaceae in Malpighiales follows the recent findings of Barkman et al. (2004, 2007), Davis and Wurdack (2004), and in particular Davis et al. (2006), who placed it with strong support as sister to Euphorbiaceae s. str. (see also above). Note that Sun et al. (2016) recovered only part of this clade, within which Euphorbiaceae s. str. are paraphyletic and Irvingiaceae are unexpected members, while the strongly-supported relationships of the few members included in the study by L. Zhou et al. (2016) are incompatible with those below.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Clade 2. [[Ctenolophonaceae [Erythroxylaceae +
Rhizophoraceae]], [Irvingiaceae + Pandaceae], [Ochnaceae [[Clusiaceae + Bonnetiaceae] [Calophyllaceae [Hypericaceae +
Podostemaceae]]]]].</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Weak support for an association of [Caryocaraceae [Linaceae + Irvingiaceae]] with [Rhizophoraceae + Erythroxylaceae] (Soltis et al. 2007a), has not been strengthened, although they have a number of features in common, such as a basally connate androecium, epitropous ovules with an endothelium, etc. (Matthews &amp; Endress 2007). Although Ctenolophonaceae, etc., might also be associated, their floral similarities did not seem to be so great. However, Wurdack and Davis (2009) found support for the clade [Ctenolophonaceae [Erythroxylaceae +
Rhizophoraceae]], but further relationships were unclear. Erthroxylaceae are commonly well supported as sister to Rhizophoraceae
(e.g. Setoguchi et al. 1999; Schwarzbach &amp; Ricklefs 2000; Chase et al. 2002; Korotkova et al. 2009). In the study by Xi et al. (2012b), the clade [Ctenolophonaceae [Erythroxylaceae +
Rhizophoraceae]] (= rhizophoroids) had strong support (see also Sun et al. 2016), [Pandaceae + Irvingiaceae] (= pandoids) had rather weak support (64% ML bootstrap, 0.97 PP). <i>Centroplacus</i> was sister to Pandaceae, but with little support (Wurdack et al. 2004); for <i>Centroplacus</i>, see Clade 3 below.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The clade [Ochnaceae [[Clusiaceae + Bonnetiaceae] [Calophyllaceae [Hypericaceae +
Podostemaceae]]]]] has only weak support (70% ML bootstrap, 0.81 p.p.: Xi et al. 2012b), but its composition is consistent with morphology; Ochnaceae and Clusiaceae et al. also have a generally similar flavonoid spectrum (Hegnauer 1990). For relationships in the core Bonnetiaceae-Podostemaceae clade (= clusioids: Xi et al. 2012b), see Wurdack and Davis (2009; also Sun et al. 2016; esp.  Ruhfel et al. 2011, 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Clade 3. [[Lophopyxidaceae + Putranjivaceae], Caryocaraceae, [Centroplacaceae [Elatinaceae + Malpighiaceae]], [Balanopaceae
[[Trigoniaceae + Dichapetalaceae] [Chrysobalanaceae + Euphroniaceae]]]].</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although this clade has strong support in Xi et al. (2012b), relationships within it are still poorly understood. The [Balanopaceae
[[Trigoniaceae + Dichapetalaceae] [Chrysobalanaceae + Euphroniaceae]]] and [Putranjivaceae + Lophopyxidaceae] clades (= chrysobalanoids and putranjivoids respectively) are well supported (see also M. Sun et al. 2016), but the [Centroplacaceae [Elatinaceae + Malpighiaceae]] clade (malpighioids) has poor support. The particular position of the distinctive Caryocaraceae is unclear, althougth there is little question that it belongs here (Xi et al. 2012b). There was some support for Picrodendraceae as sister to the chrysobalanoids in Soltis et al. (2007a: as Pseudanthaceae, Phyllanthaceae not included), but this relationship has not been confirmed.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> See Kubitzki (2013a) for a summary. A.P.G. (1998) thought that it would be useful to adopt a narrow circumscription for families that used to be included in Flacourtiaceae and Euphorbiaceae s.l. (both in Clade 1 above). Even if future work were to suggest reaggregation of genera that had been placed in those two families, the composition of the clades that were even then apparent were quite different from those in previous classifications. Indeed, the realignments caused by the break-up of the old Flacourtiaceae and integration with Salicaceae and Achariaceae correlate well with a number of morphological and anatomical characters (Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009). Furthermore, these earlier decisions are compatible with the tree in Xi et al. (2012b). To restore Euphorbiaceae to close to its old broad circumscription would require the inclusion of Linaceae, Ixonanthaceae and Rafflesiaceae, making a very heterogeneous and perplexing group. Similarly, the relationships in the clusioid group necessitated the break-up of the old Clusiaceae/Guttiferae (see also A.P.G. 2003, 2009, 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> The history of the circumscription and putative relationships of the small family Ixonanthaceae, here sister to Linaceae (Clade 1, with strong support), is an example of problems taxonomists have faced in circumscribing major groups in this whole area, and in justifying relationships - yes, there are distinctive characters, but which reliably indicate relationships?  Ixonanthaceae have been associated with a variety of families, although Van Hooren and Nooteboom (1988) noted that they had often been linked to Linaceae. Thus Robson and Airy Shaw (1962) thought that the "spiral convolution of the filaments and style" of <i>Cyrillopsis</i> (Ixonanthaceae) was a point of similarity between this genus and Irvingiaceae (Clade 2). Some species of <i>Ochthocosmus</i> (Ixonanthaceae) also have flowers very similar to those of <i>Cyrillopsis</i>, with the thin calyx reflexed after anthesis (<i>Ixonanthes</i>), while other species of <i>Ochthocosmus</i> have persistent, erect, almost scarious-looking sepals, as is common in Linaceae. <i>Allantospermum</i> has flowers very similar to those of <i>Cyrillopsis</i>, and its relationships have  presented particular problems, the genus seeming to be intermediate between the <i>Ixonanthes</i> and <i>Irvingia</i> groups.  Forman (1965) placed it with the former group, both groups, he thought, being subfamilies in Ixonanthaceae, while Nooteboom (1967) placed it in the latter group, the two being subfamilies of Simaroubaceae. Pollen suggested to Oltmann (1971) that <i>Allantospermum</i> was in Ixonanthaceae, Irvingiaceae were not related. Takhtajan (1997) included <i>Allantospermum</i>
in Irvingiaceae, close to Simaroubaceae, while Ixonanthaceae were in Rutales.  <i>Irvingia</i> was included in Simaroubaceae-Sapindales by Cronquist while Ixonanthaceae were in Linales (1981). Bove (1997: morphological phylogenetic analysis), on the other hand, suggested that Ixonanthaceae and Humiriaceae (also Clade 1, but not immediately related) were sister taxa, both having ellagic acid, a "free" annular nectary encircling the ovary, and an entire stigma. In the context of Linales (also including Linaceae, Hugoniaceae, Erythroxylaceae [also Clade 2, not immediately related to Irvingiaceae]: see Cronquist 1981), Ixonanthaceae were rather different in their free stamens, semi-inferior ovaries and pollen grains with supratectal spines (Bove 1997). Byng et al. (2016) link <i>Cyrillopsis</i> with Irvingiaceae, a position with which morphology and chemistry are in general agreement.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b>  The distinctive pollen of <i>Ctenolophon</i> is known fossil from South America and India, the earliest records being from Africa in the Upper Cretaceous ca m.y.a. (Muller 1981; Krutzsch 1989).</p>

<ul><li>Ctenolophonaceae are trees that may be recognised by their opposite,
entire leaves with interpetiolar stipules and their terminal inflorescences
with rather elongated flower buds. The
rounded sepals are persistent and accrescent, and the grey-drying and
closely-ribbed fruit is distinctive. There is a single seed that is half enveloped by the hairy aril; it remains attached to the slender central columella.</ul>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  The diversification rate in this clade may have decreased (Xi et al. 2012b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Like Humiriaceae, there are
"marginal" stomata on the nectary and the anthers have a broad
connective (Link 1992b); the wood anatomy is also similar. Takhtajan (1999) perhaps implies that there may be an endothelium, but embryology, etc., are largely unknown.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some general information is taken from van
Hooren and Nooteboom (1984, 1988b) and Kubitzki (2013b); for seed anatomy, see Huber (1991).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The crown age of Erythroxylaceae is (42.5-)19.3(-12.3) m.y. (Xi et al. 2012b: Table S7, An. + Ery.).</p>

<ul><li>Erythroxylaceae are shrubs to trees that can be recognised by their entire
leaves, stipules that are at least in part interpetiolar, and usually
fasciculate inflorescence with rather small flowers; both calyx and filaments
persist at the base of the fruit. <i>Erythroxylum</i>
itself has intrapetiolar stipules, and these are especially persistent on the closely-set bud scales, there are often longitudinal markings on the
leaves, the filaments are often of two different lengths and are basally
connate, and the fruit is a drupe.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The rate of diversification may have increased in Erythroxylaceae (Xi et al. 2012b). </p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Cocaine is sequestered by the larvae of <i>Eloria noyesi</i>, a lymanitrid moth, that feeds on <i>Erythroxylum</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The nodes were described as being unilacunar by Sinnott
(1914), however, there are lateral traces although their gaps may be inconspicuous and the traces themselves may depart from the vascular cylinder well before the central trace (Rury 1982). <i>Erythroxylum</i> sometimes has milky exudate. Are the lamina teeth theoid? The leaves
of <i>Erythroxylum coca</i> were described as being revolute by Cullen (1978);
they are involute (e.g. Peyritsch 1878; Weberling et al. 1980; Rury 1982; Keller 1996).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Matthews and Endress (2011) described the complexity of the postgenital fusion of the petals.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see van Tieghem (1903d: inc. some anatomy) and Bittrich (2013), for chemistry, see Hegnauer (1966, 1989) and Aniszewski (2007), for foliar anatomy, see van Welzen and Baas (1984), and for ovule and seed, see Rao (1968) and Boesewinkel and Geenen (1980).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> <i>Aneulophus</i> is sister to the rest of the family (M. Sun et al. 2016).</p>

<ul><li><i>Aneulophus</i> has seeds with a thick
testa, thin tegmen, and aril, opposite leaves with colleters and inter/intrapetiolar

<p>Synonymy: <b>Mangiaceae</b>
Rafinesque</p>

<ul><li>Rhizophoraceae are shrubs to trees that may be recognised by their opposite
often serrate leaves and large interpetiolar stipules. The flowers are quite often other than
5-merous, the calyx is thick and valvate, the petals are often lobed or fringed,
each enclosing one or small groups of stamens, and the ovary is often more or less inferior. Gynotrocheae and Rhizophoreae have aerial
prop roots.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  <i>Crossostylis</i>, with dehiscent fruits and arillate seeds, is embedded in Gynotrocheae, which otherwise have fleshy, indehiscent fruits and seeds without arils. Dehiscent fruits may have evolved in parallel in <i>Crossostylis</i> - Schwarzbach (2013: p. 291) describes  dehiscence there as "tardy with distal slits or an operculum", and this seems rather different from the septicidal fruits of Macarisieae, but both may have arillate seeds.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Mangrove taxa are derived within Rhizophoraceae (e.g. Schwarzbach &amp; Ricklefs 2000) and are most diverse in the
Southeast Asia-Malesian area. Their seeds
have little endosperm and are viviparous (aquatic/marine/mangrove plants commonly have large embryos, and in some the seed starts to germinate before it falls off the plant), and in all genera except <i>Bruguiera</i> the endosperm overflows from the seed, pushing open the micropyle as it does so. After the seed falls from the tree it may float in the water, and after grounding the hypocotyl straightens, lateral roots develop, and the seeding becomes established (Juncosa &amp; Tomlinson 1988b). Depending on the genus, there are either stilt roots, plank roots, or pneumatophores (Gill &amp; Tomlinson 1975). Axillary buds soon die so the plants cannot regenerate when cut or if the twigs are killed by frost, etc. (see Tomlinson 1986 for much useful information). Rhizophoraceae are an example of the relatively uncommon situation in flowering plants where salt tolerance was acquired quite deep in the phylogeny, being retained since  (Moray et al. 2015: ?6 inferred origins?).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> The term "mangrove" refers both to members of Rhizophoraceae-Rhizophoreae in particular and also to mangrove vegetation in general, of which Rhizophoreae are a prominent component, but which also includes a few palms and members of several other families. Here I am talking about mangrove vegetation - for general accounts, see Tomlinson (1986),  Spalding et al. (2010), Faridan-Hanum et al. (2014: Asian mangroves) and Hogarth (2015). For the evolution of the mangrove ecosystem, which also involves diversification of clades of molluscs, etc. (Reid et al. 2008), see Ellison et al. (1999), especially Plaziat et al. (2001 and references) and Ricklefs et al. (2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> A mere 34 species in nine genera and five families dominate mangrove vegetation, of these, half are Rhizophoraceae-Rhizophoreae, otherwise the taxa are largely unrelated. There are another 20 species in 11 genera and ten families (only one also including dominant species) that are quite common (Tomlinson 1986, estimates in Spalding et al. 2010 are 38 core species, 73 species of true mangroves). Other mangrove families include Primulaceae-Myrsinoideae (<i>Aegiceras</i>), Lythraceae (<i>Sonneratia</i>, ca 7 spp.), Acanthaceae (<i>Acanthus ilicifolius</i> and <i>Avicennia</i>, unrelated), Tetrameristaceae (<i>Pelliceria</i>) and Combretaceae (<i>Lumnitzera</i>, <i>Laguncularia</i>, 3/8 species of Laguncularieae). Of the dominant species, the palm <i>Nypa fruticans</i> in particular forms monospecific stands growing along rivers to the upper limits of tidal influence. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are two groups of mangrove species. The eastern group, from east Africa to the western Pacific, is much more speciose and includes ca 40 species, ca 14 of which are Rhizophoraceae, while the western group, from west Africa to the Americas, is made up of only eight species, three of which are Rhizophoraceae. Depending on how species limits are drawn, no major mangrove species is common to the two areas (Tomlinson 1986). This division of mangroves into the Indo-West Pacific and the Caribbean-West Atlantic areas seems to have occurred by ca 20 m.y.a. (Plaziat et al. 2001). No dominant mangrove has a non-mangrove sister taxon restricted to the New World, and diversity in the mangrove ecosystem seems to have increased regularly over time, with little extinction (Ricklefs et al. 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">However, fossil and current distributions of some mangrove plants seem to have little to do with each other, and the history of individual mangrove species is complicated. By the Eocene, ca 50 m.y.a., many mangrove genera are known from the fossil record, and several, perhaps including the Central American <i>Pelliciera</i>, are known from both the Old and New Worlds (Plaziat et al. 2001; but c.f. Mart&iacute;nez-Mill&aacute;n 2010 for <i>Pelliciera</i>). <i>Nypa</i> <a href="arecalesweb.htm#Arecaceae" target="home">(Arecaceae</a>, q.v. for fossils), today found only in the Indo-Malesian area, is first known from the Upper Cretaceous ca 70 m.y.a. and by the early Palaeocene ca 55 m.y.a. it was growing in both the Old and New Worlds (e.g. Leidelmeyer 1966 for Guyana; Plaziat et al. 2001). <i>Sonneratia</i> may be Oligocene in age (Muller 1984). Fossil hypocotyls identified as <i>Ceriops</i> and preserved with good anatomical detail are known from the Lower Eocene London Clay (Wilkinson 1981), although Collinson and van Bergen (2004) noted that the fossils did not the show distinctive curvature of seedlings of extant Rhizophoreae. At the other geographic extreme, Rhizophoreae are known from the Early Eocene 55-48.5 m.y.a. in western Tasmania, Australia (Pole 2007), and this would seem to be the earliest record of the clade - and pretty much in conflict with the family age in Xie et al. (2012b). <i>Rhizophora</i> is known from the Caribbean in the late Eocene ca 50 m.y.a., but the common ancestor of the existing Caribbean populations may have arrived in the New World only ca 11 m.y.a. (Graham 2006). There may be considerable genetic differentiation within Atlantic populations of mangrove species (Takayama et al. 2008a, b). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Mangrove plants all have physiological and anatomical adaptations to the saline, tidal aquatic hanitat (see Reef &amp; Lovelock 2015 and other papers in <i>Ann. Bot.</i> 115(3). 2015). They also tend to have large seeds/embryos, often considerably larger than their non-mangrove relatives (e.g. Moles et al. 2005a), probably connected with the need for fast establishment in the mangrove habitat where small seedlings could easily be washed away by the tides.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The mangrove ecosystem is very productive and has high carbon flux rates, and it also stores much carbon, especially below ground - at about 1,000 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup>, storage is about three times as much as in temperate, boreal or tropical upland forests. Mangroves occupy 13.7-15.2  million hectares, and they may store 4-20 PgC globally (Bouillon et al. 2008; Donato et al. 2011 and references). Other estimates are that they bury 17.0-23.6 TgCy<sup>-1</sup>, their gross primary productivity is 2087 gCm<sup>2</sup>y<sup>-1</sup>, global  primary productivity is 417 TgCy<sup>-1</sup>, but with a rather lower net ecosystem production (221 gCm<sup>2</sup>y<sup>-1></sup> and globally 44 TgCy<sup>-1</sup>) because of a relatively high respiration rate, at least as compared with sea grasses (Duarte et al. 2005: area estimated at 20 million hectares). See also <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#Cladeasymmetries" target="home">Clade Asymmetries</a> for more data; the age of carbon in the oldest deposists in a core  from Kalimantan, Borneo, may be some 24,000 years (Page et al. 2004). For salt and water balance, see Reef and Lovelock (2015) and other papers in <i>Ann. Bot.</i> 115(3). 2015.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> Pollen in Rhizophoreae is deposited on to the hairy petals, so there may be secondary pollen presentation, but pollination is basically explosive, the stamens being held in groups by the petals until the flower is tripped by the pollinator. The petals often have an arista or other appendages and are shaped like a tiny bivalve mollusc (Endress &amp; Matthews 2006b). The pollen grains are very small, and in <i>Rhizophora</i> in particular pollination may be by wind (Juncosa &amp; Tomlinson 1988b).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Growth in a number of Rhizophoraceae may be continuous, although growth patterns in Macarisieae are unknown. Cork initation in the root is superficial in at least some taxa, perhaps just those with stilt roots (see von Guttenberg 1968 for <i>Carallia</i>), and their aerial roots are polyarch (Gill &amp; Tomlinson 1975). Robert et al. (2009) discuss the hydraulic architecture of the wood of <i>Rhizophora</i>. The leaf teeth are theoid. The colleters of Rhizophoreae, at up to 1.5 mm long, are notably larger than those of other members of the family (Sheue et al. 2013: <i>Paradrypetes</i> not studied). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is considerable variation in floral merosity in the family, both carpel and stamen number varying considerably (Matthews &amp; Endress 2011). The stamens in polystemonous flowers arise from ring primordia (Ronse de Craene &amp; Smets 1992b). <i>Rhizophora</i> has transversely arranged carpels
(Eichler 1876). Variation in testal morphology in Gynotrocheae in particular is considerable, <i>Gynotroches</i> and <i>Pellacalyx</i>, with strongly exotegmic seeds, differing so much from <i>Carallia</i>, which lacks an exotegmen, that Corner (1976) preferred to segregate the former as Legnotidaceae - a comprehensive survey of seed anatomy in the family is desirable.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The morphology of the embryo of the mangrove species is interesting.  In <i>Rhizophora</i>, at least, the radicle is deep-seated in origin, and in that genus and <i>Ceriops</i> it seems to be non-functional, the root system of the seedling being developed from axillary roots; <i>Bruguiera</i> does have a functional radicle (Kipp-Goller 1939; Juncosa 1982). The cotyledons of <i>Rhizophora</i> are connate when initiated (Juncosa 1982).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">See also Juncosa and Tomlinson (1988) and Schwarzbach (2013), both general, Howard (1970: nodal anatomy), Baranova and Jeffrey (2006: leaf anatomy), Endress and Matthews (2006b: petal morphology), Carey (1934) and Mauritzon (1939a), both embryology, Tobe and Raven (1987e, 1988b: seed coat anatomy); for information on <i>Paradrypetes</i>, see also Levin (1986, 1992) and Radcliffe Smith (2001 - as Euphorbiaceae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Schwarzbach and Ricklefs (2000: <i>Paradrypetes</i> not included) found strong phylogenetic structure in the family, with three major clades. The phylogenetic structure there is basically the same as that in later studies where <i>Paradrypetes</i> has been included (e.g. M. Sun et al. 2016). At least some Macarisieae have stamens of two lengths  and well-developed anther connectives (D. Kenfack, pers. comm.), probably plesiomorphic features.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Rather surprisingly, molecular data also place <i>Paradrypetes</i>
(ex Euphorbiaceae) here (e.g. Davis et al. 2005a), strongly supported as sister to <i>Cassipourea</i> (Wurdack &amp; Davies 2008: only one species from each tribe included). <i>Paradrypetes</i> has a rather unexpected combination of characters and is highly apomorphic (see above). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Schwarzbach and Ricklefs (2000) suggested that three tribes be recognized for the three major clades that were apparent in their phylogeny of the family.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Rhizophoraceae have often been associated with Myrtales (Cronquist 1981) or Myrtanae (Takhtajan 1997), largely because of their vestured pits, opposite leaves, and inferior ovary (e.g. Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1997), and they have sometimes also included or been closely associated with (Takhtajan 1997) Anisophylleaceae, here in Cucurbitales.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Panda</i> smells like onions. <i>Microdesmis</i> has punctate leaves. The plagiotropic branches have been confused with compound
leaves, especially in the derived <i>Galearia</i> and <i>Panda</i>; the stipules may be asymmetrically placed, as in <i>Panda</i>. If the pedicels are articulated, they are articulated only at the very base.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Forman (1966), Radcliffe-Smith (2001), van Welzen (2011) and Kubitzki (2013b), Hegnauer (1969: chemistry), Nowicke (1984) and Nowicke et al. (1998: pollen), Stuppy (1996) and Vaughan
and Rest (1969), both seed anatomy,  and Tokuoka and Tobe (2003: ovules and seeds) - mostly as Euphorbiaceae. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The embryology, etc., of the family are little known.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> What is known about wood anatomy suggests that <i>Galearia</i> and <i>Panda</i> are close, while pollen suggests that <i>Galearia</i> and <i>Microdesmis</i> are close (van Welzen 2011). The relationships [<i>Microdesmis</i> [<i>Galearia</i> + <i>Panda</i>]] are strongly supported by molecular data (see Xi et al. 2012b; M. Sun et al. 2016), in line with wood anatomical variation.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> For a checklist and bibliography, see Govaerts et al. (2000, vol. 4). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Pandaceae were included in Euphorbiaceae until quite recently, e.g. Govaerts et al. (2000) and Radcliffe-Smith (2001), but they differ from even the uniovulate taxa (Peraceae and Euphorbiaceae s. str.) in several respects, including their indehiscent fruits. Rays of Euphorbiaceae are only 1-5 cells wide (Hayden &amp; Hayden 2000); Pandaceae usually lack obturators, while Euphorbiaceae have them - another difference. <i>Dicoelia</i>
(Euphorbiaceae - Dicoelieae) and <i>Galearia</i> both have stamens in
depressions in the petals. However, <i>Dicoelia</i>
has a low, thin-walled testa, a massive exotegmen, and a moderately thickened
mesotegmen (Stuppy 1996), and belongs in Phyllanthaceae (Kathriarachchi et al. 2005). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Engler had trouble with <i>Panda</i>, mistaking its plagiotropic branches for compound leaves, so he described it first as a species of Burseraceae, then as a species in Sapindaceae, and after he recognized his mistake, he was still unclear as to its relationships and placed it in a monotypic Pandales (Forman 1966).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The crown age of this clade is (106.7-)101.5(-96.4) m.y.a. (Xi et al. 2012b: Table S7), ca 100.9 m.y. (Tank et al. 2015: table S1, S2), around 150, or even 185 m.y. (Bissiengou et al. 2015b), or (124.9-)120.6, 115.4(-104.2) m.y. (Ruhfel et al. 2016: app. S9).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Several of the characters above are suggested as possible synaporphies for Ochnaceae by Schneider et al. (2014a). Optimization of characters like ovule number and styles free (= styluli +)/fused is difficult.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Lamina venation in this whole clade is interesting. Schneider et al. (2016), in their study of the venation of Ochnaceae, a family often with very close secondary veins and not much else or a very well developed and close reticulum, noted that the normal vein order/leaf size scaling relationships (for which, see Sack et al. 2012) in eudicots had in part broken down. <i>Calophyllum</i> (Calophyllaceae) also in this clade, was similar (Sack et al. 2012). Indeed, taxa with rather odd venation like closely parallel secondary venation are scattered throughout this family group, and include <i>Neblinaria</i> (no midrib at all, = <i>Bonnetia</i>) and other Bonnetiaceae, <i>Endodesmia</i> (Calophyllaceae), some species of <i>Clusia</i> and <i>Garcinia</i> (Clusiaceae), and so on,  while of course Podostemaceae are vegetatively a law unto themselves. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> It is quite common for the calyx to be small relative to the corolla in bud (e.g. Matthews et al. 2012 for Ochnaceae), so the corolla has taken over the protective function for the bud, although in taxa like <i>Calophyllum</i> and <i>Clusia</i> the bud is at first completely enclosed by the sepals. Pollen grains in general are quite often small, but there is substantial variation in the [[Bonnetiaceae + Clusiaceae] [Calophyllaceae [Hypericaceae +
Podostemaceae]]] clade (Furness et al. 2013b, c.f. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Van Tieghem (1902) early thought that on balance Clusiaceae s.l. and Ochnaceae might be close, largely because of the polystemony of the former and also of some of the latter.</p>

<p>Synonymy: <b>Quiinaceae</b> Engler, <i>nom. cons.</i></p>

<ul><li>Ochnaceae are evergreen trees whose leaves are usually serrate, stipulate and with dense and prominent venation.</ul>

<ul><li>Ochnoideae are recognisable by their alternate, often
coriaceous leaves with rather sharply serrate margins, more or less brochidodromous venation
- the secondary veins can be very closely parallel - and rather scaly stipules that have strong,
parallel veins and also may have fringed margins. The rather scarious calyx is also distinctive, the anthers often open by
pores, and the style is sometimes gynobasic. </ul>

<ul><li><i>Medusagyne</i> has a
distinctive fibrous bark rather like that of <i>Juniperus</i>. Its leaves are opposite, toothed, and with
very strongly reticulate venation. The
flowers, with their contorted petals, numerous stamens and carpels with
marginal styles are distinctive, as are the fruit, the valves of which pull
away from the central columella, except at their apices, so looking rather like a parasol of sorts (a name for the plant is the jellyfish tree). </ul>

<ul><li>Quiinoideae may be readily
recognised, even when sterile, by their opposite or whorled, sometimes compound or deeply lobed (especially in seedlings), strongly
stipulate leaves; the secondary veins are well-developed and the fine venation looks like the strokes of a paint brush, and the stipules are more or less persistent. There are well-developed mucilaginous canals. Both stipules and sepals are pubescent and the often baccate fruits are striate when dry.</ul>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The diversification rate in Medusagynoideae may have slowed down (Xi et al. 2012b). Indeed, throughout this family there is substantial clade size imbalance [1 [[4 + 18] [[5 + 77] [2 + 388]]]] [1 [3 + 49]].</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The very long stem of Ochnaceae, over 70 m.y. by some estimates, could reflect extinction at the K/P boundary, although the length of that stem suggests ages for angiosperm evolution as a whole that are perhaps unlikely. Bissiengou et al. (2014b) suggest that Ochnaceae originated in America, the ancestors of <i>Medusagyne</i>, now restricted to the Seychelles, perhaps getting where they did via extensive migration over the North Atlantic land bridge via India. Ocean crust separating India and the Seychelles started to form ca 63.4 m.y. old (Collier et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A number of "features of systematic interest", "possible synapomorphies", etc., listed in bold by Matthews et al. (2012) have been placed tentatively at their appropriate hierarchical levels. Schneider et al. (2014a) suggest numerous apomorphies throught the family, which I have tried to follow. however, I have not placed monosymmetric flowers as an apomorphy for Ochnoideae (with subsequent reversals), mainly because the flowers are monosymmetric in three different ways.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> The often very dense - and beautiful - venation of many Ochnaceae has attracted attention. Unlike the common relationships between the different levels of the venation hierarchy in eudicots (Sack et al. 2012), the secondary veins may be very numerous and close, and sometimes also very fine, or the reticulum in general may be close and well-developed, yet there is also reversal to more conventional venation (Schneider et al. 2016). Interestingly,  the relationship between vein density and stomatal density, reflecting an aspect of photosynthetic efficiency, and venation construction costs are little affected, and species of Ochnaceae with these distinctive venation systems are common on the poor and sandy soils of the Venezuelan Guayana (Schneider et al. 2016). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Buzz pollination is common/prevalent in Ochnaceae, and although the anthers have an endothecium, it is sometimes restricted to the area around the anther pore or pores. In Sauvagesieae a cone formed by petaloid staminodes closely surround the fertile stamens (dehiscence varies from pores to longitudinal slits); pollen comes out of the apex of the cone, which functions as a pore, when the flower is buzzed (Kubitzki &amp; Amaral 1991). There may have been reversal from dehiscence by pores to dehiscence by slits (Amaral 1980; Amaral &amp; Bittrich 2004, 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Sauvagesia</i> lacks vestured pits; two other genera in Ochnoideae are recorded as having them (Jansen et al. 2001).  <i>Godoya</i> has stratified phloem. There are mucilage cells or mucilage
channels throughout the family that are to be found in various places in the plant, and the plants sometimes have a watery exudate.</p>
 
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is considerable variation in floral morphology in Ochnaceae-Ochnoideae. <i>Sauvagesia</i> has numerous linear staminodes, five petal-like staminodes opposite the petals, and five stamens opposite the sepals. The antesepalous primordia of <i>Ochna</i> (Ochnoideae-Ochneae) show
centripetal androecial development (Pauz&eacute; &amp; Sattler 1978), while the androecia of members of the other tribes have centrifugal development (Amaral &amp; Bittrich 1998). Zygomorphy is largely the result of the
unequal later development of the androecium, but in <i>Philacra</i> and <i>Luxemburgia</i>
it is evident early in development (Amaral &amp; Bittrich 1998).  <i>Lophira</i> has
unequally accrescent sepals, two members forming wings (there are only two carpels, each with many ovules, and the testa is thin). Placentation is often axile, but it can be laminar, as in <i>Wallacea</i>, or parietal, as in <i>Schuurmansia</i> (Amaral &amp; Bittrich  2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is also variation in the ovule, etc., of <i>Ochna</i>, alternatively, some reports must be incorrect. Chikkannaiah and Mahalingappa (1974) suggest that there is no endothelium, although the nucellar epidermis seems to take over that function (but see Endress et al. 2012). Batygina et al. (1991, p. 222)
show <i>Sauvagesia erecta</i> as having a much enlarged endotesta with thick
walls.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For further information on Ochnoideae, see Amaral
(1991),  Kanis (1968), Matthews et al. (2011) and Amaral and Bittrich (2013), all general, Hegnauer (1966, 1989: chemistry), van Tieghem (1903c: root anatomy), Decker (1966: Luxemburgieae) and Dickison (1981), both anatomy,  van Tieghem (1902: general, esp. embryo, 1904 and references),  Ronse De Craene and Bull-Here&ntilde;u (2016: androecium), Baum (1951: gynoecium), and Narayana (1975) and Gu&aacute;d&egrave;s and Sastre  (1981), both embryology,  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In <i>Medusagyne</i> the upper ovules are ascending and
epitropous, the lower ovules descending and apotropous (Batygina et al. 1991;
Doweld 1998b). For a comparison of the fruit dehiscence of <i>Medusagyne</i> with that of some Ochnaceae, particularly some Sauvagesioideae, see Fay et al. (1997a); the anatomy of the fruits is similar to
that of Caryocaraceae (Dickison 1990a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Additional information on <i>Medusagyne</i> is taken
from Dickison and Kubitzki (2013: general), Beauvisage (1920: anatomy), Robinson et al. (1989: morphology), Dickison (1990a, 1990b: morphology and anatomy), and Matthews et al. (2012: floral morphology). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The venation of the leaves of Quiinoideae is very distinctive, although not that dissimilar from that of other Ochnaceae, and it was studied in detail by Foster (1952 and references). Veinlets ending free in the mesophyll can be few or even absent. The stomata are described as being paracytic by Schneider et al. (2002).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Kubitzki (2013b) and Schneider and Zizka (2014), for wood anatomy, see Gottwald and Parameswaran (1967), and for many details of floral morphology, see Matthews et al. (2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In both Quiinoideae and <i>Medusagyne</i> some of the ovules in each carpel abort. For pollen of the Ochnaceae s.l., see Furness (2013b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> There is good molecular support for a monophyletic Ochnaceae s.l., e.g. Fay et al. (1997a),
Nandi et al. (1998), Savolainen et al. (2000a), Chase et al. (2002) and Korotkova et al. (2009), although relationships between the three main clades that make up the family were less clear.  However, Xi et al. (2012b: as families) found moderate (75% ML bootstrap; 1.00 p.p.) support for a [Medusagynoideae + Quiinoideae] clade, support is weaker in Wurdack and Davies (2009) and not terribly strong in Schneider et al. (2014a). The tribes and their relationships are all well supported in the study by Schneider et al. (2014a: 4 plastid loci + ITS; see also Bissiengou et al. 2014b; M. Sun et al. 2016).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bissiengou et al. (2014a) examined relationships within Ochneae, and although support was sometimes not very good, <i>Campylospermum</i> may be polyphyletic. <i>Elvasia</i> (Ochnoideae-Ochneae) is morphologically very distinct: it has congenital carpel connation, an ovary with commissural lobes, terminal, shortly branched style with punctate stigmas, and non-vascularized integument, but it is clearly embedded in Ochneae (see also Schneider et al. 2014a). Within Quiinoideae, <i>Froesia</i> is sister to the other genera (Schneider et al. 2006, esp. 2014a, see also Schneider et al. 2002 for a morphological phylogeny; Wurdack &amp; Davies 2009). Relationships among the other three genera are unclear.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Both Quiinoideae and <i>Medusagyne</i> are particularly poorly known embryologically, etc..</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Including Ochnaceae, Medusagynaceae and Quiinaceae in Ochnaceae s.l. is an optional arrangement in A.P.G. II, and they have much in common; Ochnaceae s.l. are recognized in A.P.G. III (2009). The tribal classification above is that of Schneider et al. (2014a); they also describe subtribes.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> <i>Diegodendron</i> was included in Ochnaceae by Cronquist (1981), it is here placed in
Malvales as Diegodendraceae (see also Amaral 1991).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Medusagyne</i> is morphologically very distinctive. Comments on the species cover of <i>Medusagyne</i> at the
Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, ca 1985: &quot;c.f. <i>Actinidia</i>. - Would be much better placed in
Guttiferae or Hypericaceae - !!!!! - this plant allied to Myrtales. - Nonsense!
- oh yes it is!&quot; Hardly surprisingly, it was
placed in a monotypic Medusagynales (Theanae) by Takhtajan (1997) and generally
associated with Theales (e.g. Cronquist 1981); the latter was already such an heterogeneous group that the further inclusion of practically anything made little difference to its description. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> This node can perhaps be dated to the Cenomanian (104-)94, 89(-87) m.y.a. (Davis et al. 2005a: note topology), (91-)89.5(-88.4) m.y. (Xi et al. 2012b: Table S7), around 148-110 m.y. (Bissiengou et al. 2015b), (116.9-)110.6, 102.9(-92.3) m.y. (Ruhfel et al. 2016: app. S9), or as little as 54-45 m.y.a. (Wikstr&ouml;m et al. 2001).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Ruhfel et al. (2016) looked at distribution patterns in the whole clade, observing that most of the numerous disjunctions they observed, some forty nine in all, were best explained by dispersal rather than Gondwanan-age vicariance-type events - thus there were no fewer than eleven dispersals to, but none from, Madagascar, for example.  They also noted that their estimates of clade ages varied depending on where the the problematic fossil <i>Paleoclusia</i> was placed, whether as the most recent common ancestor of Clusiaceae or that of [Bonnetiaceae + Clusiaceae]. Estimated ages using the former position were older, sometimes, as with the crown-group age of Clusiaceae, the age estimates of the two calibrations showed no overlap (Ruhfel et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are several potential morphological synapomorphies for the clade (see Ruhfel et al. 2013 for some ancestral state reconstructions). Variation in seed/diaspore size is considerable (see also  Moles et al. 2005a). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b>  For a summary of the chemistry of the group, see Crockett and Robson (2011); exactly where on the tree particular classes of secondary metabolites are to be placed will depend  on more detailed sampling. Xanthones are uncommon elsewhere in seed plants, being known from Gentianaceae, some Moraceae, etc.. The xanthones of Podostemaceae are similar
to those both of Gentianaceae (in their -6-0-glucosides) and of Clusiaceae (in their isoprenyl
substitutions). Benzophenone has the formula (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Given the likely phylogenetic relationships above, anatomical studies of Bonnetiaceae are needed to clarify the apparent absence - or near absence - of secretory tissues there. Takhtajan (1993) describes the pith of Bonnetiaceae as having secretory canals, as in Clusiaceae, but c.f. Baretta-Kuipers (1976).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Furness (2012) summarized the palynolgical variation - considerable - in this clade; some characters were optimised on an outline tree, but there was not much obvious phylogenetic signal (see also Furness 2014 for pollen of <i>Medusagyne</i>).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Morphological data in particular (most of the features above) initially seemed to suggest a grouping of [Elatinaceae + Bonnetiaceae + Clusiaceae/Hypericaceae], seed anatomy and gross morphology of Elatinaceae and some Hypericaceae in particular being similar (e.g. see versions 4 and earlier). This was not a monophyletic group in
Savolainen et al. (2000a), indeed, <i>Ploiarium</i> is there even placed in Malvales (but see Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009), although testa anatomy, etc., are strongly against such a position. Analyses in Chase et al. (2002) weakly linked Elatinaceae and Bonnetiaceae with
Clusiaceae + Podostemaceae. Evidence now suggests that Elatinaceae are sister to Malpighiaceae (Davis &amp; Chase 2004; Davis et al. 2005a; Tokuoka &amp; Tobe 2006; Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009), and some morphological data support this. Bonnetiaceae link with Clusiaceae s.l. in morphological phylogenetic analyses (e.g. Luna &amp; Ochoterena 2004: Hypericaceae not included). Some early molecular work linked Podostemaceae with Hydrostachyaceae (see Cornales), although this may in part have been a sampling probem; no Malpighiales, etc., were included (Les et al.  1997a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Relationships within this clade  were initially
unclear (see also Soltis et al. 1999b; Gustaffson et al. 2002; Davis et al. 2005b), although Wurdack and Davis (2009) and particularly Ruhfel et al. (2011, 2013, see also Xi et al. 2012b) have confirmed the paraphyly of the old Clusiaceae. Relationships are [[Bonnetiaceae + Clusiaceae] [Calophyllaceae [Hypericaceae + Podostemaceae]]], and support is generally quite strong, although that for the [Bonnetiaceae + Clusiaceae] clade is the weakest (Xi et al. 2012b; Ruhfel et al. 2013). The branch leading to Podostemaceae is rather long. Meseguer et al. (2014a: nuclear markers) found that <i>Podostemon</i>, the only Podostemaceae they examined, was  sister to <i>Vismia</i>, although support was not strong.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> The old Clusiaceae (see versions 8 and before) were strongly paraphyletic, so continuing to include all the genera that used to be include there, and making Cluisceae monophyletic, would entail the inclusion of Bonnetiaceae, Hypericaceae and Podostemaceae - and the latter has one of the most distinctive morphologies of all flowering plants. For the "price" of recognizing Podostemaceae, we have five coherent and moderately easy recognizable clades.</p>

<ul><li>Bonnetiaceae may be recognised by their long-pointed
buds, usually rather closely-set, spiral, short-petiolate and minutely-serrate
leaves. The moderate-sized flowers are
borne in cymose inflorescences, the corolla is contorted, the stamens are
numerous, and the septicidal capsules contain many small seeds.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Bonnettia</i> s.l. has tri- or multilacunar nodes, a mucilaginous epidermis, a
foliar endodermis, and foliar sclereids; <i>Archytaea</i> and <i>Ploiarium</i>
have unilacunar nodes and lack the mucilaginous epidermis, foliar endodermis and
sclereids (Dickison &amp; Weitzman 1996). The absence of any secretory system should be confirmed. Keller (1996) described the leaf vernation as being involute.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Bonnetia</i> often has 3-trace petals while the bracetoles sometimes have only a single trace (Dickison &amp; Weitzman 1998). For <i>Archytaea</i>, Wawra de
Fernsee (1886) shows a floral diagram in which both the five carpels and the
stamen fascicles are drawn opposite the calyx. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The spread of crown ages of this clade is (72.4-)52.9(-30.4) m.y. (Xi et al. 2012b: Table S7), around 51-42 m.y.a. (Bissiengou et al. 2015b), or as much as  (92.8-)91.1, 63.6(-52.2) m.y. (Ruhfel et al. 2016: app. S9).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">An interesting and well-preserved late-Cretaceous fossil ca 90 m.y.o., <i>Paleoclusia chevalieri</i>,  from New Jersey, U.S.A., is possibly assignable to Clusiaceae (Crepet &amp; Nixon 1998; see also Friis et al. 2011). The seeds are described as being arillate, but the position of the aril is unlike that of extant Clusiaceae (it is adjacent to the seed, rather than surrounding it), and it may be an aborted seed (Ruhfel et al. 2013). If used in calibrations, where it is placed on the tree affects ages of the whole group (see  <a href="malpighialesweb.htm#BontoPod" target="home">above</a>).</p>

<p>7/48: <i>Symphonia</i> (23). Tropical, few mainland Africa.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Crown-group Symphonieae are around (46.6-)44.3, 44.1(-42.3) m.y.o. (Ruhfel et al. 2016: app. S9).</p>

<ul><li>Clusiaceae range from shrubs to trees, and some are
epiphytic; many are dioecious. The leaves are opposite and exstipulate, the blades are often thick, with entire margins,  and usually have resin
canals. A white or yellow exudate is very common. The flowers have free sepals and petals and
numerous stamens that are sometimes in fascicles. The fruit, when dehiscent, opens
along the septal radius. The seeds are small to large, arils being known from many New World taxa, and the embryos are often apparently undifferentiated - the cotyledons are small to almost absent and the
hypocotyl is enormous.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The around 750 species in Garcinieae and Clusieae,  about 93% of the whole family,  have diverged within the last 25 m.y. or so (Ruhfel et al. 2016: fig. 1).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Garcinia</i> is one of the five most diverse genera in West Malesian l.t.r.f. (Davies et al. 2005); its members are mostly rather small trees. In the New World, the speciose <i>Clusia</i> includes epiphytes and stranglers many of which are more or less leaf succulents, and a number grow at elevations up to 3500 m (Gustafsson et al. 2007). Furthermore, a number of species in the <i>C. minor</i> and <i>C. flava</i> groups (see Gustafsson &amp; Bittrich 2002) have strong to weak crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) (Holtum et al. 2004;  L&uuml;ttge 2008), and CAM has evolved twice or more in species of <i>Clusia</i> from Panama alone (Gehrig et al. 2003). The development of CAM may be promoted by phosphorus deficiency; in species of <i>Clusia</i> like <i>C. pratensis</i>  CAM is facultative (Winter &amp; Holtum 2014; L&uuml;ttge 2008). (Whether or not the plant is mycorrhizal also affects the plant's phosphorus and carbon metabolism - Maiquet&iacute;a et al. 2009.) Barrera Zambrano et al. (2014) discuss CAM and C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis in <i>Clusia</i> in the context of its leaf anatomy, although that doesn't seem to be very distinctive. <i>Clusia</i>, shrubby to tree-like and often an inhabitant of lowland tropical rainforest, differs from most other CAM species which are small, either epiphytes (of course, <i>Clusia</i> is often an epiphyte) or plants of dry conditions, and quite often annuals (for major foci of CAM photosynthesis, see <a href="asparagalesweb.htm#Orchidaceae" target="home">Orchidaceae</a>, <a href="caryophyllalesweb.htm#CartoHec" target="home">centrosperms</a>, etc.; L&uuml;ttge 2008). For the general ecology of <i>Clusia</i>, see papers in L&uuml;ttge (2007). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> Bittrich et al. (2006) summarize information about the role of oils, resins, etc., in the pollination of the family; see also Amaral et al. (2016). Variation in the androecium in <i>Garcinia</i> and <i>Clusia</i> in particular is extreme. For additional details of androecial morphology in <i>Garcinia</i> and its immediate relatives, see Sweeney (2008, 2010), Leins and Erbar (1981) and Leal et al. (2012); the nectary is unlikely to be staminodial. Little is known about pollination in that genus.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Stamens in <i>Clusia</i> may be fused or free, the filaments are often massive, with canals in which resins are produced and a vascular system that can be quite complex, sometimes forming a ring (S&aacute;-Haiad et al. 2015), the anthers can be locellate and thecate or athecate, or there is an outer annular sporangium surrounding a small central spherical sporangium (<i>C. valerioi</i>: Hochwallner &amp; Weber 2006), and so on. The endothecium is locally absent to about three cell layers across, and this affects how the anther dehisces (see also S&aacute;-Haiad et al. 2015; Amaral et al. 2016). In <i>Clusia</i>, resins (almost pure polyisoprenylated benzophenones mixed with fatty acids) are a common floral reward (Porto et al. 2000; Nogueira et al. 2001), and plants may also produce oils to reduce the viscosity of the resins (Porto et al. 2000). Floral resins are involved in pollination in about half the genus, as well as in the <i>Clusia</i> look-alike, <i>Clusiella</i> (Calophyllaceae) (Gustafsson &amp; Bittrich 2002; Bittrich et al. 2006; Gustafsson et al. 2007; S&aacute;-Haiad et al. 2015). Floral resin production has evolved three or four times or so, but it has also been lost at lest twice (Gustafsson et al. 2007). Depending on the species, resin and pollen may be mixed or presented separately (Amaral et al. 2016). Euglossine and especially stingless <i>Trigona</i> (meliponine) bees have been observed at <i>Clusia</i> flowers (Bittrich &amp; Amaral 1986; Porto et al. 2000; Bittrich et al. 2006; Martins et al. 2007; Amaral et al. 2016), while the cockroach <i>Amazonia platystylata</i> may pollinate <i>C.</i> aff. <i>sellowiana</i> (Vlas&aacute;kov&aacute; et al. 2008). Interestingly, species of <i>Clusia</i> growing at higher altitudes, where bees are less common, produce nectar as a floral reward (Armbruster 1984). In general, resins are an uncommon floral reward in   angiosperm flowers, but see also <i>Dalechampia</i> (Euphorbiaceae) and <i>Maxillaria</i> (Orchidaceae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In the American <i>Symphonia globulifera</i> pollen is suspended in a distinctive oil which is picked up by hummingbirds and then deposited in a droplet that exudes through the pore at the tip of the stylar branches; the droplet and the pollen it contains is then sucked back into the pore (Bittrich &amp; Amaral 1996; Bittrich et al. 2013). All other Symphonieae have similar stigmas, and so the pollination mechanism is likely to be the same throughout the tribe; bird pollination is known in other American Symphonieae like <i>Moronobea</i> and <i>Platonia</i> (Bittrich et al. 2013 for references).</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fragrant oils are produced in the stout filaments of the flowers of <i>Tovomita</i>, and these attract male euglossines. The composition of the fragrances in three different species growing in the Ducke Nature Reserve was found to be quite different (Noguiera et al. 1998).   </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The distinctive exudates of <i>Garcinia</i> have been called xanthics (Lambert et al. 2013). For resins, see e.g. Porto et al. (2000) and Bittrich et al. (2006); whether the benzophenones are polyisoprenylated or both polyisoprenylated and  benzoylated may have taxonomic significance in <i>Clusia</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Roots of <i>Clusia</i>, at least, may have superficial phellogen, as is fairly common in epiphytic taxa in general. Genera like <i>Dystovomita</i> and <i>Garcinia</i> have distinctive basal intrapetiolar hood-shaped structures whose development needs study; see Cruz et al. (2015) for the stipular nature of apparently similar structures in <i>Metrodorea</i> (Rutaceae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Hochwallner and Weber (2006)  described the androecium of <i>Clusia valerioi</i> as being fasciculate, but this is not obvious from the illustrations. Puri (1939), Leal et al. (2012) and Tobe and Raven (2011) described the ovules as being bitegmic, while Corner (1976) and Asinelli et al. (2011) described them as being unitegmic. However, variation in ovule, seed, and fruit in Clusiaceae in general is considerable and poorly understood and would repay a broad and careful survey.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For chemistry, see Hegnauer (1966, 1989), for floral morphology of the distinctive <i>Clusia gundlachii</i>, see Gustafsson (2000), for that of other Clusiaceae, see Mour&atilde;o and Beltrati (1995) and  Mour&atilde;o and Marzinek (2009), and for general information, see Stevens (2006c).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Clusieae are a well-supported clade clearly sister to the rest of the family (e.g. Ruhfel et al. 2016). However, the relationships of Symphonieae and Garcinieae are less clear, although they are provisionally separated here; there is no strong evidence for their reciprocal monophyly. Thus Gustaffson et al. (2002) found that Garcineae were embedded in Symphonieae, Ruhfel et al. (2011) did recover a monophyletic Symphonieae, but  there was no support for a monophyletic Garcineae, they were branches of a comb, while Ruhfel et al. (2016) recovered both as monophyletic. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The relationship between <i>Allanblackia</i>, with its numerous ovules per carpel, and <i>Garcinia</i> s.l., with but a single ovule per carpel, are unclear, and the former may be derived from the latter, and there is an African clade made up of <i>Allanblackia</i> and some species of <i>Garcinia</i> (Gustafsson et al. 2002; Sweeney 2008; Ruhfel et al. 2011, 2013, 2016).  Less problematically, the old <i>Tripetalum</i> and <i>Pentaphalangium</i> are to be included in <i>Garcinia</i>. Within Clusieae, <i>Dystovomita</i> is sister to the rest of the tribe and <i>Tovomita</i> is polyphyletic (e.g. Ruhfel et al. 2016). There is good support for an monophyletic <i>Clusia</i>, and many of the classicial sections are turning out to be monophyletic, but relationships between these sections are less clear (Gustafsson et al. 2007). Within Symphonieae, <i>Symphonia</i> is sister to the other genera (Rufel et al. 2016).</p>  

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> <i>Clusia</i> is to include genera like <i>Renggeria</i>, <i>Decaphalangium</i>, etc., previously segregated from it (Gustafsson et al. 2007)..</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The crown-group age of Calophylleae is only  (42.9-)31.8, 29.5(-19.4) m.y. (Ruhfel et al. 2016: app. S9).</p>

<ul><li>Calophyllaceae are usually trees that may be recognised by their
exstipulate leaves with entire margins and pellucid dots or
canals; there is often some exudate from the cut twig. The flowers have free sepals and petals - usually white or pink - and
numerous stamens; the stamens are not obviously in groups and the anthers sometimes
have large, apical glands. The fruit, when dehiscent, opens
along the septal radii; the seeds
range from small to large, and when large, they are made up almost entirely of two
huge cotyledons.</ul>

  <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Although Calophylleae are far more diverse than Endodesmieae, they have a very long stem and have diverged only within the last 35 m.y. or so (Ruhfel et al. 2016). Fossils assignable to the ,i>Mammea americana</p> group are  known from Panama in deposits ca 19 m.y.a. (Nelson &amp; Judd 2016).</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 30px;">The recent discovery of <i>Calophyllum africanum</i> in southwest Mali, mainland Africa, apparently related to the New World  <i>C. antillanum</i>, is biogeographically perplexing (Cheek &amp; Luke 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Calophyllum longifolium</i> (the only species of the genus examined) has unusually dense parallel secondary veins with transverse secondaries compared to those of the  484 other species of angiosperms studied (Sack et al. 2012); some Ochnaceae are similar (Scneider et al. (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> Buzz pollination occurs in <i>Kielmeyera</i>, while the distinctive cup-shaped anther glands more common on the related <i>Caraipa</i> are thought to secrete fragrances (Bittrich et al.  2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Although all species of <i>Calophyllum</i> have opposite leaves when adult, a few species have seedlings with alternate leaves (Stevens 1980).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Marila asymmetralis</i>, alone
in the clusioids, has obliquely monosymmetric flowers. The androecial (and gynoecial) morphology of <i>Endodesmia</i> and <i>Lebrunia</i> needs study; is it fasciculate (Ruhfel et al. 2103)? The glands on anthers of genera like <i>Caraipa</i> are large, paired and crateriform, perhaps because the contents have been removed, while in other genera like <i>Kayea</i> they are small and rounded.  As in Clusiaceae, variation in ovule and seed morphology and anatomy is poorly understood; most data on ovule morphology come from Old World taxa.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For chemistry, see Hegnauer (1966, 1989, as Guttiferae), for some anatomy, see Beauvisage (1920), general information, see Stevens (2006c, as Clusiaceae), for fruits and seeds, see Mour&atilde;o and Beltrati (2000), and for the distinctive foliar fibres of many species of <i>Mammea</i>, see Dunthorn (2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> <i>Endodesmia</i> is sister to the rest of the family (<i>Lebrunia</i> has not been sequenced), which otherwise separates into largely Old and New World clades, although these are not always well supported (Ruhfel et al. 2011, 2013, 2016). <i>Clusiella</i> is embedded in the latter clade (see also Gustaffson et al. 2002; Rufel et al. 2016). Its seeds and vegetative anatomy (including the deep-seated phellogen of the root) are consistent with this position, although the flowers are a little odd, since they do indeed look like those of <i>Clusia</i>. Also in the New World clade, there is a group of largely alternate-leaved genera that form a clade (Ruhfel et al. 2013, 2016); these
genera (e.g. <i>Kielmeyera</i>, <i>Caraipa</i>) also have capsular fruits, often with quite large, winged seeds, and their embryos have large cotyledons with cordate bases. <i>Kayea</i> and <i>Mesua</i>, until quite recently considerd to be congeneric, occur on the two main branches in the Old World clade (e.g. Ruhfel et al. 2016). Relationships suggested by M. Sun et al. (2016) are somewhat different.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Many Theaceae also have spiral leaves, capsular fruits, winged seeds, and flowers with many stamens. Alternate-leaved Calophyllaceae seemed superficially to be similar and so used to be placed in that family, more or less "intermediate" between Theaceae and Guttiferae, groups
that turn out not to be closely related at all (c.f. Baretta-Kuipers 1976).</p>

<p><a name="HypPod"><u>[Hypericaceae +
Podostemaceae]</u></a>: stigma surface rounded, with papillae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Divergence between Podostemaceae and Hypericaceae may have occurred as early as the Cenomanian, (106.5-)97.6, 90.9(-79.9) m.y. (Ruhfel et al. 2016: app. S9), (82-)76, 72(-66) m.y.a. (Davis et al. 2005a), ca 75 m.y.a. (Tank et al. 2015: Table S2), (78.4-)69.7(-59.3) m.y.a. (Xi et al. 2012b: Table S7), or as recently as (56-)43, 42(-26) m.y.a. (Bell et al. 2010) or still more so, (42-)40, 36(-34) or (28-)26(-24) m.y.a. (Wikstr&ouml;m et al. 2001).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b>  Meseguer et al. (2013: rooting?) suggested an age of (66-)53.8(-43) m.y. for crown Hypericaceae, (63-)53.7(-42.5) m.y. is the spread in Xi et al. (2012b: Table S7),  (62.7-)52.3(-45) m.y. in N&uuml;rk et al. (2015), or (93.3-)77, 71.5(-56) m.y. (Ruhfel et al. 2016: app. S9).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the fossil record of the family, both pollen and seeds, see Meseguer and Sanmart&iacute;n (2012). Seeds of the fossil <i>Hypericum antiquum</i> from deposits in W. Siberia 40.4-33.9 m.y.o. (see Budantsev 2005: p. 110, 111) are not particularly uniquely hypericaceous, although the exotestal cells in vertical rows are distinctive. <i>Hypericum virginianum</i> has rather different cell types with the walls of individual cells being largely separate, while the  electron micrographs of the latter seem different yet again (Meseguer &amp; Sanmart&iacute;n 2012); perhaps c.f. also <i>Elatine</i>, some <i>Nymphaea</i>, Passifloraceae s.l., etc., for similar seeds.</p>

<ul><li>Hypericaceae include numerous herbs or shrubs. Their leaves are opposite and with pellucid or dark dots; the flowers are often yellow; the
androecium is often fasciculate and/or the stamens are numerous; the stigma is sometimes obviously papillate; and
the seeds are small, being usually less than 4 mm long.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b>  <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  Meseguer et al. (2013, 2014b; see also N&uuml;rk et al. 2015) discuss diversification of the genus in detail, integrating past distributions and past ecological preferences with the present, and they suggest that the ancestor of Hypericaceae may have been African, while the stem lineage of <i>Hypericum</i> itself was in the holarctic region by 50-35 m.y.a., depending on the models used. N&uuml;rk et al. (2015) thought that that diversification in <i>Hypericum</i> could be explained by a late Eocene niche shift as the stem clade became adapted to cooler conditions, only some 15 m.y. later did diversification rates in the genus increase, in part triggered by cooling temperatures ca 14 m.y.a. and in part by dispersal (twice) into South America, orogenesis in various parts of its range also contributing to the rate shifts. There are major Old and New World clades of <i>Hypericum</i>; the African <i>H. lalandii</i> is well embedded in the latter - probably long distance dispersal - although Africa was thought to be home of ancestors of the genus (Meseguer et al. 2013, q.v. for more details). Diversification of the ca 70 p&aacute;ramo species has been dated to (5.6-)3.8(-2.3) m.y. and has been accompanied by extensive variation in flower size, etc., the plants ranging from prostrate shrublets to shrubs up to 6 m tall (N&uuml;rk et al. 2014). <i>Hypericum</i> has also diversified in alpine habitats elsewhere (Hughes &amp; Atchison 2015 and references). For more dates within <i>Hypericum</i>, see Meseguer et al. (2013) and N&uuml;rk et al. (2014, 2015)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> The chirality of the contorted corolla varies within an individual in <i>Hypericum</i>, but it seems to have little effect on pollination (Diller &amp; Fenster 2014, <!--2016-->).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Like other bat-dispersed plants in the New World, <i>Vismia</i> tends to be a member of early successional communities (Muscarella &amp; Fleming 2008). It dominates succession on old pastures, forming dense and persistent stands partly because of its root suckers (Mesquita et al. 2001). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Production of  hyperforins (acylphloroglucinols, present in pale glands) and hypericins (phototoxic anthraquinones, present in dark glands) increased in <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> when eaten by generalist herbivores, but not by specialists (Sirvent et al. 2003).</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Seed Dispersal.</u> Fruits of New World <i>Vismia</i> are an important food for phyllostomid bats such as <i>Carollia</i> (Lobova et al. 2009).  The bats are fast feeders, ingesting the fruits and voiding the seeds in their faeces. Resin and seeds are collected from <i>Vismia</i> fruits by <i>Melipona</i> bees in the Neotropics  and used to construct nest entrances, etc. (Roubik 1988).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> The naptha-dianthrone hypericin may be synthesized by an endophytic fungus close to <i>Chaetomium</i> (Kusari et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Hypericin, common here, is a red-colored derivative of anthraquinone. Details of the system of canals and spherical translucent reddish (schizogenous) or black (solid) glands in the plant, and what these structures secrete, are poorly understood (N&uuml;rk et al. 2012 and references). For the secretory structures in the vegetative parts of <i>Hypericum</i>, see in particular Curtis and Lersten (1990), Sirvent et al. (2003) and Lotocka and Osinska (2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For chemistry, see Hegnauer (1966, 1989, as Guttiferae) and Crockett (2012: <i>Hypericum</i>), for the anatomy of <i>Cratoxylum</i>, etc., see Baas (1970), for the wood anatomy of <i>Hypericum</i> s.l., see Gibson (1980), for androecial development, etc., see Robson (1974 and references: fascicle/fasciclode number), Leins and Erbar (1991, 2010), Leins (2000) and  Ronse de Craene and Smets (1991e: <i>Harungana</i>), for ovules, see Guignard (1893) and Nagaraja Rao (1957), for fruits and seeds of <i>Vismia</i>, see Mour&atilde;o and Beltrati (2001), and for seeds of <i>Hypericum</i>, see Robson (1981) and Meseguer and Sanmartin (2014). For some general information, see Stevens (2006c).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> The basic relationships within Hypericaceae are sometimes recovered as [Cratoxyleae [Vismieae + Hypericeae]] (e.g. Ruhfel et al. 2016), however, N&uuml;rk et al. (2015) found the relationships [Vismieae [Cratoxyleae + Hypericeae]]. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Vismieae, <i>Harungana</i> and the African <i>Vismia rufescens</i> form a clade with the American <i>Vismia</i> examined; the other African Vismieae studied formed a sister clade (Ruhfel et al. 2011, 2013; Xi et al. 2012b). N&uuml;rk and Blattner (2010) discussed relationships and evolution in <i>Hypericum</i> in an analysis of morphological characters; the groupings they found had little support. Ruhfel et al. (2011) found some support for an expanded <i>Hypericum</i>, including <i>Thornea</i>. In a much more extensive study of <i>Hypericum</i>, N&uuml;rk et al. (2012: ITS only; see also P&iacute;lepic et al. 2011) found that <i>Thornea</i> was sister to <i>Hypericum</i>, but support for that position was not strong. In the analysis of Meseguer et al. (2013: four genes, inc. ITS), <i>Thornea</i> was a member of a basal polytomy, <i>Triadenum</i> was clearly to be included in <i>Hypericum</i> (see also Ruhfel et al. 2011; Meseguer et al. 2014; Z.-D. Chen et al. 2016), and some of the sections that N&uuml;rk et al. (2012) had found to be monophyletic were here paraphyletic.  <i>Santomasia</i> was not included in these analyses. More recently, N&uuml;rk et al. (2015) has recovered a largely similar set of relationships, but again, support for the basal branchings was not strong. For diversification of South American <i>Hypericum</i>, see N&uuml;rk et al. (2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Generic limits need attention, with those of <i>Hypericum</i> and <i>Harungana</i> in particular probably needing to be expanded (Ruhfel et al. 2009, esp. 2011; c.f. in part Stevens 2006c). For a sctional classification of <i>Hypericum</i>, see Robson (2012) and references; Robson (2016) adjusted this somewhat to take on board molecular findings on relationships, unthought of when he began his studies.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Crown-group Podostemoideae are some (63.9-)53.3, 49.7(-40.3) m.y.o. (Ruhfel et al. 2016: app. S9).</p>

<p>Synonymy: <b>Marathraceae</b> Dumortier</p>

<ul><li>Podostemaceae are the quintessential aquatic angiosperm
with a vegetative body so highly modified that conventional terms cannot be
used to describe it. The plant body of many taxa is best called thalloid
or fucoid, although some species look like a demented apiaceous plant with
two-ranked leaves; many species are
annuals. The flowers, or groups of flowers, are often enveloped in a spathella;
the capsule is septicidal, and the small seeds are often mucilaginous.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Podostemaceae typically grow in fast-flowing rivers and in rapids, several species often being found together, and they may well be the only angiosperms in such places. They are unusual among aquatic angiosperms in that they do not reproduce asexually and even the perennial species flower and fruit profusely (Philbrick &amp; Novelo R. 1997).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The dry seeds are very small and dust-like, often less than 320 &mu;m long, although they can be around twice that size (Philbrick &amp; Novelo R.  1997). For germination and establishment, see e.g. Grubert (1970, 1976), Mohan Ram and Sehgal (1997), Leleeka Devi et al. (2016), and others. The testa swells and becomes mucilaginous, firmly attaching the seed to a rock and although the radicle may not develop, there are often dense "rhizoids" (= root hairs: Rutishauser 1997) at the base of any hypocotyl or radicle that is present, allowing the seedling to attach firmly. Haptera ("hapters") or holdfasts develop, apparently from the stem, and attach the plant to the rock.  Furthermore, although there have been suggestions (e.g. Rutishauser 1997) that Podostemaceae are attached to rocks by means of a special glue that they produce, it is more likely that it is materials in a biofilm produced by associated cyanobacteria that attach the plant to the substrate, hooked hairs on the root or stem of the plant sticking to the cyanobacterial filaments and associated biofilm (J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn &amp; Grubert 2000). Indeed, these cyanobacteria may even produce nitrate that is used by the plant; Podostemaceae usually grow in oligotrophic rivers flowing over gneiss or granite, being absent in rivers over limestone  (J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn &amp; Grubert 2000).</p>


 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Wind pollination may be common in Podostemaceae, but the sometimes very large numbers of sseds/fruit produced would be distinctly unusual if that is the case (Philbrick &amp; Novelo R. 1997). Some members of the family self pollinate, the pollen tubes growing through the tissue of the flower to the ovules (Sehgal et al. 2009).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> A biofilm produced by a variety of cyanobacteria is involved in attaching the plant to the rocks on which it grows (see above: J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn &amp; Grubert 2000).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> Interpretations of the plant body of Podostemaceae, the "thallus", vary greatly. The podostem plant body can be thought of as a very highly modified but ultimately fairly conventional plant (J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn 1997b: p. 93, importance of "principles of variable proportions", 2005a), to a somewhat less enthusiatic embrace of classical morphological categories (Rutishauser 1997), to thinking about the podostem plant body as <i>sui generis</i>, with saltational evolution invoked to explain how the very different and distinctive morphologies in the family have evolved (Koi &amp; Kato 2010).  See also Koi and Kato (2007) for hypotheses on nature of shoots and leaves and Sehgal et al. (2007) for organ identity. Since Podostemaceae are sister to Hypericaceae and Calophyllaceae in turn, detailed studies of the latter may provide clues for the evolution of the growth of the former, particularly building on the developmental studies of e.g. Katayama et al. (2010, 2013). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Podostemaceae with ribbon-like roots have opposite branching, those with a crustose or foliose growth form have endogenous shoots born singly on the upper surface. The evolution of the remarkable flattened roots of some Podostemoideae and Tristichoideae, which lack caps but have meristematic regions on both sides, from the more ordinary-looking roots found in Weddelinoideae and some other Tristichoideae has been carefully documented by Koi et al. (2006). The exogenous or superficial origin of roots of some Podostemoideae is unusual, roots normally being endogenous and initiated inside the pericycle; <i>Cladopus</i> has both exogenous and endogenous lateral roots (Rutishauser &amp; Pfeifer 2002). Whatever their origin, roots often have root caps.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The apex of the stem has a tunica-corpus construction. There is some controversy over whether normal axillary branching occurs or not (e.g. Rutishauser et al. 2005; J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn 2009a). Some taxa have shoots arising endogenously in the cortex (e.g. Moline et al. 2007). In the dithecous leaves of Podostemoideae the leaf bases have two concave sheaths facing in opposite directions and with a flower or branch bud in the axils of each; these leaves usually terminate growth of the axis that bears them  (Rutishauser et al. 2003); for the optimisation of these dithecous leaves on a phylogeny of Podostemoideae, see Moline et al. (2007: note the adaxial position of the prophyll of the axillary dithecal vegetative shoot illustrated). J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn (2009b) also depicts the dithecous leaf as being adaxial on the axillary shoot that bears it. Interesting, the determinate ramulus system of Tristichoideae also involves the initial development of one or two cataphylls, the first (or only) cataphyll may be adaxial in position (Fujinami et al. 2013); there a distinction is made between cataphylls and scale leaves, although <i>Terniopsis</i>, sister to the rest of the subfamily, which is supposed to form a pair of leaves (?cataphylls) on all branches before the "ordinary scaly leaves" is not shown in their Fig. 6 as having such leaves. Fujinami and Tmaichi (2015) put the evolution of flattened shoots in Tristichoideae in a phylogenetic context. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Katayama et al. (2010, see also 2013) found from gene expression patterns in two Podostemoideae that it is almost as if a determinate "leaf" caps the indeterminate stem, new leaves/branches developing endogenously from the base of the "leaf". Since separation of the young "leaves" is by cell death, they will lack an epidermis, hence, perhaps, the absence of stomata in the subfamily - although they might be found on the flowers, in which there is more normal development (e.g. Katayama et al. 2008).  To summarize: The  huge and complex literature on podostem morphology badly needs a comprehensive and critical examination. Major reinterpretations contunine, for instance, J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn et al. (2016) recently reintepreted the  pinnate leaves of <i>Castelnavia noveloi</i> as foliate roots.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The "epidermal" cells of Podostemoideae have dimorphic chloroplasts; smaller chloroplasts are found against the outer periclinal walls and much larger normal-looking chloroplasts against the inner periclinal walls (Fujinami et al. 2011, 2015). Grubert (1976) noted distinctive contents in cells of young plants of several Podostemaceae.  For SiO<sub>2</sub> bodies, see Machado da Costa (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The nature of the spathella is unclear. Unlike bracts in Podostemoideae examined, its development is that of a "typical organ of leaf homology" (Katayama et al. 2010, see also Katayama et al. 2008), there is sometimes an apical meristem in the vegetative body of Podostemoideae and the spathella may be produced by the connation of two foliar structures (J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn 2005b).   Eckardt and Baum (2010) suggest more specifically that it is calycine, however, there can be more than one flower per spathella so it cannot be simply calycine. Some species of <i>Dalzellia</i> (Tristichoideae) have a cupule at the base of the pedicel that is formed by leafy shoot axes (Mathew et al. 2001).</b>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Tristicha</i> - A 1, adaxial, median carpel abaxial? (Schnell 1998). The
position of the stamens may suggest an obliquely monosymmetric flower (Cusset
&amp; Cusset 1988b), while Razi (1955; see also Endress &amp; Matthews 2006a) described the flowers of <i>Zeylanidium olivaceum</i>, which have a spathella, two stamens and two carpels, as being monosymmetric. The outer integument develops early and the nucellus protrudes
beyond the inner integument. The plasmodial
nucellus has been described as a pseudo-embryo sac; see J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn (1997) for variation in details of its development. Tobe and Raven (2011) describe the tegmen as being unspecialised.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is considerable variation (and a corresponding amount of controversy) over the development of the embryo sac in particular, perhaps especially in <i>Weddellina</i> (see e.g. Battaglia 1971; Arekal &amp; Nagendran 1975, 1977a, b; Nagendran et al. 1976; Murgu&iacute;a-S&aacute;nchez et al. 2002; Sehgal et al. 2011a). Is it mono- or bisporic, and does it have 3, 4 or 5 cells at maturity? However, there is general consensus that there is no double fertilization, the single polar nucleus degenerating (Sehgal et al. 2011b). During development of the embryo, the nucellus becomes plasmodial (different pathways are involved) and helps in the nutrition of the embryo (see J&auml;ger-Z&uuml;rn 1997b). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although the embryo usually lacks a plumule and radicle, these were reported for <i>Malaccotristicha</i> sp. (Kita &amp; Kato 2005). Seedlings of Podostemoideae have a hypocotyl, and short hypocotyls have even been reported in Tristichoideae (e.g. Mohan Ram &amp; Sehgal 1997). Koi et al. (2012b) discuss seedling evolution in the family, and see also Suzuki et al. (2002) for seedlings. More information is needed on embryo morphology (but see Koi &amp; Kato 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> The basic phylogenetic structure of the family is [Tristichoideae [Weddellinoideae + Podostemoideae], all clades having very strong support (Kita &amp; Kato 2001; see also Kita 2002: phylogeny and morphology; esp. Koi et al. 2012a; Ruhfel et al. 2016; etc.). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">See Moline et al. (2007) for the phylogeny and evolution of African Podostemoideae, Koi and Kato (2010) that of Asian Podostemoideae, and Khanduri et al. (2015: Indian members of the family, also a morphological matrix). In New World Podostemoideae morphological analyses allowed the recovery of a few small generic clades, but molecular data resolved quite a number of nodes (Tippery et al. 2011). The recently-described <i>Diamantina</i> appeared to be sister to all other Podostemoideae (Ruhfel et al. 2009), although that genus was not studied by Tippery et al. (2011), who found <i>Podostemon</i> and a paraphyletic <i>Mourera</i> as successively sister to the rest, while <i>Diamantina</i> was sister to the other members of one of the two major clades into which the subfamily was resolved in Ruhfel et al. (2016) - <i>Mourera</i> belonged to that clade, <i>Podostemon</i> to the other. Koi et al. (2012a: very good sampling) confirmed the position of <i>Diamantina</i>, although support was weak; further large scale structure in Podostemoideae mostly had very little support, and generic monophyly seems to be almost a foreign concept there. See also M. Sun et al. (2016) for details of relationships.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Koi et al. (2009) discussed the phylogeny of Tristichoideae (and described a distinctive new genus), while Koi et al. (2012a) found groupings in Tristichoideae to be well supported and the genera to be monophyletic (see also Ruhfel et al. 2016: <i>Terniopsis</i> sister tpo the other genera).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Many genera are monotypic, the morphology of the thallus being so bizarre. For generic limits in some African Podostemoideae, see Thiv et al. (2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Prior to molecular work, systematists were largely at a loss as to where the relationships of Podostemaceae were to be found. The micropylar suspensor haustorium seemed like
that of Crassulaceae, perhaps suggesting a link between the two families (e.g. Les &amp; Philbrick 1996; Ueda et al. 1997a), or isolated in its own order in Rosidae (Cronquist 1981), etc.. Indeed, Podostemaceae have sometimes been placed apart from all other angiosperms (e.g. Cusset &amp; Cusset 1988b). </p>

<ul><li>Putranjivaceae are trees to shrubs that may be recognised by their two-ranked,
often rather coriaceous and stipulate leaves that are asymmetric at the base and dry a
greyish color; they frequently taste peppery or like an inferior radish  (mustard oils!) when
fresh, although this taste may take a little time to develop. The
fasciculate flowers are frequently rather small and the single-seeded drupe is often crowned by the
persistent, flap-like stigmas.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Some analyses suggest that the diversification rate in Putranjivaceae increased (Xi et al. 2012b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> Glucosinolates make the flowers of <i>Drypetes</i> smell very strongly indeed, and they are produced consitutively; bees, wasps and beetles have been recorded visiting <i>Drypetes natalensis</i> (Johnson et al. 2009c).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Perhaps not surprisingly, caterpillars of pierid butterflies have quite often (23/2690 records) been recorded eating Putranjivaceae (see also Brassicales and Fabaceae) - nothing so far is known about Lophopyxidaceae - species of the Indo-Malesian <i>Appias</i> subgenus <i>Catophaga</i> (albatrosses) feeding more or less indiscriminately on <i>Drypetes</i> (Putranjivaceae) and Capparaceae (Yata et al. 2010). In <i>Drypetes natalensis</i>, at least, constitutively-released isothiocyanates are part of the floral odour, but what exactly they do is unclear (Johnson et al. 2009a).</p>

<ul><li>Although hardly very distinctive, <i>Centroplacus</i> is a dioecious evergreen tree with serrate and stipulate leaves. It can be recognised by its branched inflorescences of small flowers; the staminate flowers have only five stamens in which the connective is well developed and the anthers dehisce by two oblique-apical slits.</ul>

<ul><li><i>Bhesa</i> species are usually evergreen trees with leaves that have the stipules almost surrounding the stem while the blades are entire and have strong, regularly-ascending secondary veins and distinctive closely scalariform tertiary venation; there is a pulvinus at the apex of the petiole. The flowers are small and are rather undistinguished, but the fruits are strongly bilobed and have arillate seeds.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> An odd couple. Xi et al. (2012b: some analyses) found that diversification rate in this clade slowed down...</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> <i>Bhesa</i> is reported to be ectomycorrhizal (Smits 1994).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The ribbon-shaped exotegmic cells of <i>Bhesa</i> are longer than those of <i>Centroplacus</i>, and its integument is much thicker. The endostome of <i>Centroplacus</i> is lignified and more or less protruding.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Kubitzki (2013b): <i>Bhesa</i> is often under Celastraceae, see Pierre (1894), Ding Hou (1962) and Wurdack and Davis (2009), genearl information, for seed and vegetative anatomy of <i>B. ceylanica</i>, see <i>Jayasuriya &amp; Balasubramaniam 3107</i>, for seeds of <i>B. robusta</i>, see Corner (1976). <i>Centroplacus</i> is often in Euphorbiaceae: see Forman (1966) and Radcliffe-Smith (2001), both general, Stuppy (1996: seed anatomy and good discussion), and Tokuoka and Tobe (2001: seed anatomy, ?Euphorbiaceae-Phyllanthoideae). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Studies of the embryology, etc., of both genera are much needed.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Cai et al. (2016) show <i>Centroplacus</i> rather surprisingly embedded in a paraphyletic <i>Bhesa</i>; no comment was made, but this might perhaps be a rooting artefact.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Recognising the two genera as a single family seems most reasonable, although they are very different in their gross morphology. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> <i>Centroplacus glaucinus</i> has been placed in Pandaceae (Takhtajan 1997; Mabberley 1997), but Webster (1994b)
and Radcliffe-Smith (2001) included it in Euphorbiaceae, but only with hesitation and with little certainty as to where it should be placed within the family. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Bhesa</i> was distinctive in
morphological analyses of Celastraceae, in which it used to be included (Simmons &amp; Hedin 1999; Matthews &amp; Endress 2005b), if sometimes with some doubt (e.g. Pierre 1894 [he thought it might be in a separate family]; Metcalfe &amp; Chalk 1950; Ding Hou 1962). Its huge stipules, distinct styles, vessels with scalariform perforation plates, etc., were somewhat out of place there, although Celastraceae were so heterogeneous that a strong case could not be made for its removal. The seed coat, with its massive exotegmic cells, is also very different, as are its pentalacunar nodes. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Cai et al. (2016) suggested that the American/African disjunction between stem-group Malpighiaceae and Elatinaceae reflected Gondwanan vicariance.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Depending on the interpretation of variation, both the evolution of monosymmetric flowers and flowers with an inverted orientation can be pegged to this node (W. Zhang et al. 2009a, 2010: see also the discussion after Malpighiaceae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For the foliar glands and resin and latex production in Elatinaceae and Malpighiaceae, neither well understood, see Vega et al.

<ul><li>Malpighiaceae are a distinctive family, with their usually
opposite, entire leaves with paired stipules (these vary in position). The unicellular hairs are T-shaped, often a characteristic brown in colour,
and there are often conspicuous flat glands on the lower surface of the leaf blade or on the petiole. The flowers are usuallu upside down and are often (weakly) monosymmetric, an adaxially-positioned petal then being a banner petal, 4 or 5
sepals often have abaxial paired glands, the petals are strongly clawed and are
crumpled in bud, and there are usually three carpels, each with a single ovule. The sepals and filaments often persist at
the base of the fruit, which is often a samara with a variable number of wings.
</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The rate of diversification may have increased in Malpighiaceae (Xi et al. 2012b). An origin of the family in South America during the Late Cretaceous has been suggested, with several - it now appears to be nine - subsequent migration/dispersal events to the Old World followed by the loss of oil secretion by the sepals in the taxa involved (Davis et al. 2002a, b, 2004; esp. Davis &amp; Anderson 2010; see also below). Malpighiaceae in Mexico are very diverse in seasonally-dry tropical forest, and this is because of the numerous (over 30) dispersal events from the south as much as subsequent diversification of these clades in Mexico. Initially animal-dispersed clades (more l.d.d.) were involved, but there was an increase in wind-mediated dispersal events in the mid-Miocene ca 24 m.y.a. when connections with South America may have been established (Anderson 2013; Willis et al. 2014 [see also B. Bremer &amp; Eriksson 1992]; Bacon et al. 2015a; Montes et al. 2015: geology re-evaluated, but c.f. <i>Proc. National Acad. Sci. U.S.A.</i> 112(43): E5765-E5678 and especially O'Dea et al. 2016: comprehensive refutation).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology.</u> Malpighiaceae are one of the three ecologically most important groups of lianes in the New World tropics, around 400 species being lianescent (see also Bignoniaceae-Bignonieae and Sapindaceae-Sapindoideae: Gentry 1991; additional information in Angyalossy et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> New World members of the family are noted for having oil flowers, a trait that is probably plesiomorphic in the family.  Oil is secreted by paired glands, epithelial elaiophores, on the backs of the sepals. Several genera of Apidae and solitary Centridini (<i>Epicharis</i>, <i>Centris</i>: paraphyletic, see below) are pollinators. Centridini bees have tufts of hairs on four legs that the insects use to get the oil from the glands on the sepals (Martins et al. 2014), at the same time holding on to the flower by grasping the narrow base of the adaxial banner petal with their mandibles; this banner petal is often distinctively coloured, and may change colour as it ages (Renner &amp; Schaefer 2010 and references). Note that flowers of New World Malpighiaceae have a "monocot" orientation, the flower being rotated 36<sup>o</sup>, and so the odd petal, the banner petal, is adaxial (W. Zhang et al. 2010). At least some species with apparently yellow flowers - yellow flowers are common in the family - are bee UV-green (Papadopulos et al. 2013). Bezerra et al. (2009) discussed the pollination networks formed by bees and plants, and found them to be very resilient to the loss of species of either (see also Mello et al. 2012: 75 bee and 64 malpig spp.), although activities of the bees on flowers other than those of malpigs were not discussed. Trigonid bees visit the flowers of New World malpigs for pollen (Anderson 1979), and some taxa are buzz pollinated (Sigrist &amp; Sazima 2004). Davis et al. (2014b) note that the floral morphology of these New World oil-secreting taxa is not very variable, even if there are many species there; they attribute this to stabilizing selection rather than some kind of inherent developmental stasis.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The flowers of some Oncidiinae orchids mimic (both Batesian and M&uuml;llerian mimicry) those of Malpighiaceae (see esp. Papadopulos et al. 2013). The orchids may even provide distinctive fatty acids as a reward that are similar to those of Malpighiaceae (Reis et al. 2007 and references); the mimicry unit of the orchid is formed largely by the labellum, with the column being visually similar to the malpighiaceous banner petal. Other Oncidiinae have a distinctive shiny green nectary-look alike on the labellum, which may otherwise be white. In addition to the calyx glands, Malpighiaceae may have small glands, osmophores, on the fimbriate margins of the petals, as well as glands on the anther connectives, but these have a less clear role in pollination (Possobom et al. 2015).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Cardinal and Danforth (2013) suggested that Centradini (<i>Centris</i> 230 spp.; <i>Epicharis</i> 35 spp.) and <i>Tetrapedia</i> bees which take oil from Malpighiaceae, evolved in the Late Cretaceous, 87-52 and 92-66 m.y.a. respectively, and these ages and the family ages above are broadly consistent. Martins et al. (2014a; see also Hedtke et al. 2013) found Centradini to be paraphyletic, <i>Epicharis</i> diverging (102-)91(-79) m.y.a. and <i>Centris</i> (95-)84(-72) m.y.a., about contemporaneous with Xi et al.'s (2012b) estimate of the stem-group age of Malpighiaceae of (100-)86(-73) m.y. (75-60(-32) m.y.a. above), and broadly consistent with some kind of co-evolutionary story. Crown ages of  <i>Epicharis</i> are (39-)28(-18) m.y.a. and of <i>Centris</i> (58-)44(-36) m.y.a., rather younger than most family ages. Fossils of <i>Eoglandulosa warmanensis</i> from the Eocene Claiborne Formation in Tennessee, U.S.A., and ca 34 m.y.o. show the distinctive paired glands on the sepals (Taylor &amp; Crepet 1987; Friis et al. 2011). Details of the evolution of the association between the bees and malpigs are currently unclear. </p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">In <i>Galphimia brasiliensis</i> the subbasal glands on the lamina margins have the same anatomy as small glands on the sides of the sepals towards the base, both secreting oil (Castro et al. 2001). However, Lobreau-Callen (1989) recorded the leaf/bracteole glands of <i>G. bracteata</i> as producing sugars.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Oil is secreted by New World taxa only. There are about 150 species of Old World Malpighiaceae, relatively few compared to the New World, and there have been around 9 separate dispersal events to the Old World (see above). Overall they show much more variation in basic floral morphology than their New World relatives, and this is associated with the adoption of different pollinators and pollination mechanisms. Their flowers may be radially symmetrical and/or have a "normal" floral orientation for a core eudicot  with the odd petal abaxial (W. Zhang et al. 2010), and this has happened independently in the separate clades (Davis et al. 2014b). <i>Hiptage</i>, especially <i>H. benghalensis</i>, shows very pronounced monosymmetry with unequal stamen lengths and anther sizes (heteranthy), an adaxial banner petal, and a single nectar-secreting gland between the two adaxial sepals; this is associated with the presence of four <I>CYC</I>2-like genes (W. Zhang et al. 2016: see cover photo of <i>Internat. J. Plant Sci.</i> 177(7). 2016). The calyx glands may secrete nectar (Vogel 1974, 1990; Ren et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2016: the median gland in <i>Hiptage</i> secretes oils in some species), although in most pollen is the only obvious reward (Davis &amp; Anderson 2010). The anthers may be porose or have slits, and the flowers are on occasion mirror images and have a single stamen much larger than the rest (Ren et al. 2013). The flowers tend to be more or less polysymmetric, the petals are less strongly clawed, and the style branches are longer and more widely spreading (Davis &amp; Anderson 2010 for illustrations).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Self-fertilization is common in species of <i>Gaudichaudia</i>, <i>Janusia</i> and relatives. Here pollen tubes grow from the indehiscent anther through the tissues of the flower to the embryo sac (Anderson 1980; X.-F. Wang et al. 2011). Apomixis -
nucellar polyembryony - is common, and embryo sac development and reproduction in general is very variable; as Johri et al. (1992: p. 450) noted "failure of fertilization is a common feature of Malpighiaceae". </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Genes &amp; Genomes.</b> There have been duplication(s) of <i>CYC</i> genes, and <i>CYC2</i> genes are expressed only in the adaxial part of the flower in monosymmetric Malpighiaceae. However, details of exactly when gene duplication occurred and what changes in pattern of gene expression there have been are unclear (W. Zhang et al. 2010). Polysymmetry is associated with changes in the expression of the <i>CYC2</i> gene, and these differed in each case of the evolution of polysymmetry studied (Zhang et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Acridocarpus</i>
has spiral, exstipulate leaves. Some species of <i>Stigmaphyllon</i> have leaves with palmate venation and toothed margins; some taxa, especially when young, have almost fimbriate lamina margins, albeit distantly so (the fimbriae are ca 4 mm long). Stipules are very
diverse, being petiolar in <i>Hiraea</i> and cauline in many vines and also in <i>Malpighia</i>;
in the latter genus they may be lobed or toothed.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The flowers of <i>Acridocarpus</i>
have an inferior ovary with only two fertile carpels. Although Lorenzo (1981) suggested that the nucellar beak was produced by periclinal divisions of the epidermal cells, i.e., it would technically be a nucellar cap, the cell wall patterns do not suggest this.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Testa anatomy may repay investigation. In <i>Mascagnia macrodisca</i> there is a layer of thin-walled, slightly elongated cells with brown contents over a layer of more or less isodiametric, lignified cells with somewhat more thickened and straight anticlinal walls, the latter layer having  a "frosted" appearance; the origin of these cell layers is not known (pers. obs.). Given that the main protective part of the propagule is not the seed coat, testa and tegmen are likely to be more or less reduced.  In <i>Banisteriopsis</i> there is vascular tissue in the testa, and the seed is more or less exotestal (Silva &amp; Trombert 2008). <u>Endo</u>tegmic fibres may be quite conspicuous (Silva &amp; Trombert 2006), but since fibres in other Malpighiales are exotegmic and Elatinaceae also have exotegmic seeds (but see above), what is going on in Malpighiaceae is unclear.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some information on chemistry is taken from Hegnauer (1969, 1989: iridoids have been reported from <i>Stigmatophyllum</i>) and Lee et al. (2012: monofluoroacetates); for embryology, etc., see also Stenar (1937),  A. M. S.

<ul><li>Trigoniaceae are evergreen trees that may be recognised by their simple, entire,
stipulate leaves that often have whitish indumentum below; dark glandular hairs or glands are common. The flowers are obliquely monosymmetric and are papilionaceous in their general appearance; the standard petal is more or less saccate or spurred.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Trigonia</i> has opposite leaves, interpetiolar stipules, and split lateral vascular bundles; lamina glands are not obvious. The bracts of <i>Trigoniastrum</i> are more or less glandular, with large glands on the abaxial surfaces, <i>Trigonia</i> has stalked glands variously on pedicels or petioles and margins of bracts and leaves, while <i>Humbertiodendron</i> has concave marginal glands towards the base of the leaf blades.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For floral morphology, I follow the
interpretations of Warming (1875) and Eichler (1878) rather than that of
Cronquist (1981). Schnizlein (1843-1870:
fam. 233) draws the flowers as being more or less vertically monosymmetric, while the orientation shown by Schatz (2001) is difficult to work out; in the latter it appears that the corolla may be quincuncial. Warming (1875) showed the nectary glands as
being part of the androecial whorl; Lleras (1978) describes them as being &quot;disc
glands&quot;.  In any event, the androecium at least sometimes seems to have more than 10 stamens. Testa anatomy is similar to that
of Linaceae, but the two are not immediately related.</p>

<ul><li>Dichapetalaceae are trees or often lianes that may be recognised by their lenticillate twigs and stipules that are sometimes fimbriate, often dark
greyish-drying leaf blades with secondary veins that loop and join towards the margin; the venation is particularly
prominent on the abaxial surface, where there are also often flat glands. The inflorescences are cymose and &plusmn;
obviously coming from the petiole; the small flowers have deeply bifid petals which dry
blackish and fall off in their entirety if not fertilized leaving the prominent pedicels behind. The fruit is a drupe that is often flattened and/or lobed and is covered by short, dense, erect hairs which often give a shiny, almost golden appearance.</ul>

Hairs have been found in the ovary loculi in flower, but they are not apparent in the capsule, even if it has not yet opened (pers. obs.).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Some analyses suggest that the diversification rate in Euphroniaceae decreased (Xi et al. 2012b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Lleras (1976) suggested that the (long)
staminode of <i>Euphronia</i> was in the position of the fertile stamen of
Vochysiaceae (that was a time when the two were thought to be related), Marcano-Berti (1995) that there is a staminal tube and four
stamens of two different lengths. Prance and Sothers (2003) in a table comparing the four families note that <i>Euphronia</i> lacks a disc.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> The age of crown-group Chrysobalanaceae may be Palaeocene, around 59-58 m.y. (Bardon et al. 2012), rather older, some (74.9-)66.2(-60.3) m.y. (Xi et al. 2012b: Table S7, <i>Atuna</i> and the rest), or as young as  (37.3-)33.4(-30.2) m.y. (Bardon et al. 2016).</p>

<ul><li>The family can be recognised by its strongly lenticillate twigs and two-ranked,
often rather shortly petiolate and nearly always entire leaves; these either dry blackish grey
and/or have well-developed scalariform tertiary venation. The stipules are often long and early deciduous, there are often broad, flat glands on the
abaxial surface of the lamina, and the petiole is more or less
swollen at one or both ends. The wood is very hard and the bark feels gritty when it is crumbled, which it quite easily does when hit with a bush knife; there may be a red exudate from the trunk. The flowers have a hypanthium, there are often many long stamens, the style is more
or less gynobasic, and the ovary is often borne on one side of the hypanthium. The single-seeded fruit is usually relatively
large and the endocarp is often conspicuously hairy inside.</ul>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For the fossil record of Chrysobalanaceae, see Jud et al. (2016);  modern genera had evolved and the family as a whole was widely distributed by the early Miocene.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Chrysobalanaceae are possibly Old World in origin, probably moving from the paleotropics to the neotropics whether by long distance dispersal or the North Atlantic land bridge, and most of the diversity in the family is in a neotropical clade whose arrival there is dated to ca 29.5 m.y.a., mid Oligocene, although most diversification within this clade is Miocene and younger (Jud et al. 2016; Bardon et al. 2016); the age of thecrown  neotropical clade in Bardon et al. (2012) is (57-)47(-40) m. years. The net rate of diversification was overall higher in the neotropics than the palaeotropics, despite also having a higher extinction rate. The driver of all this is unclear, particularly since the family is found in lowland habitats and Africa has often been thought of as the area likely to have a higher extinction rate (Bardon et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Chrysobalanaceae are common in terms of both numbers of species and individuals with stems at least 10 cm d.b.h. in the Amazonian tree flora, but they do not have a disproportionally high number of common species (ter Steege et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Seed Dispersal.</u> For seed dispersal, generally by animals, see Prance and Mori (1983).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> For the association between Amazonian <i>Hirtella</i> species of section <i>Myrmecophila</i> and their obligate ant associates, <i>Allomerus</i> spp., see Rico-Gray and Oliveira (2007) and Ruiz-Gonz&aacute;lez et al. (2011); the ant cultivates an ascomycete fungus whose hyphae strengthen the ant galleries within which the ants lurk, coming out to ambush their prey. However, the ant domatia drop from older leaves of <i>H. myrmecophila</i>, otherwise <i>A.  octoarticulata</i> would eat the inflorescences, effectively sterilizing the plant (Izzo &amp; Vasconcelos 2002).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Chrysobalanaceae, rich in silica, contribute notably to the pool of phytoliths (Piperno 2006). Syllepsis is uncommon both here (Keller 1994), and probably more generally in the whole group of five families.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Cronquist (1981) suggested that the pollen grains might also be colpate.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For more information, see Prance (2013) and Prance and White (1988: nicely illustrated), both general, Hegnauer (1973, 1990: chemistry), Badami and Patil (1981: seed fatty acids), Morvillez (1918: petiole vasculature), Tobe and Raven (1984: embryology), and LaFrankie (2011: field characters).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> A recent molecular study (Yakandawala et al. 2010) yielded support for the monophyly of the genera but poor resolution of deeper relationships, and suggested that groupings apparent in earlier morphological "taximetric" studies (Prance et al. 1969; Prance &amp; White 1988) should be reexamined; the situation remained largely unchanged in the study by Bardon et al. (2012), with practically no support for relationships along the backbone of the tree. <i>Licania</i> may be wildly para/polyphyletic,  and <i>Hirtella</i> and <i>Coupeia</i>, especially the latter, are also not monophyletic (Sothers et al. 2014; for problems with the first two genera, see also Bardon et al. 2016). There is some support for <i>Atuna</i> being sister to the rest of the family, perhaps in a clade with one or two other taxa including <i>Kostermanthus</i> (Bardon et al. 2012; see also Wurdack &amp; Davis 2009), although basal relationships were unclear in Sothers et al. (2014: <i>Atuna</i> not included), <i>Maranthes</i> and <i>Parinari</i> perhaps being near basal.  For relationships around <i>Licania</i>, see Sothers et al. (2016). Bardon et al. (2016) found the poorly-kmown <i>Kostermanthus</i> alone to be sister to the rest of the family</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> See Prance (1989: New World Taxa), and Prance and Sothers (2003a, b: world monograph), but genera are beginning to be reworked nomenclaturally as relatiomships become better understood (Sothers et al. 2014: <i>Coupeia</i>, 2016: <i><i>Licania</i></i>).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> The flowers of some Chrysobalanaceae look rather like those
of <i>Prunus</i>, and Chrysobalanaceae and Rosaceae were often considered to be
close (e.g. Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1997), either recognized as separate families but placed more or less adjacent in the sequence, or Chrysobalanaceae might even be included as a subfamily of Rosaceae. However, there are numerous differences
between them (see table in Prance 1972a). </p>

<ul><li>Humiriaceae are evergreen trees that may be recognised by their blackish-drying,
short-petiolate, toothed leaves which elongate while still rolled up and often
have longitudinal lines down the abaxial surface of the blade; the buds on growing shoots are
long-pointed. The young twigs are angled, and in the juvenile forms of some species they are winged. The cymose inflorescences
have rather small flowers with broadly rounded sepals, the filaments form a tube, and the anthers have conspicuously prolonged
connectives. The fruit is a drupe with a ridged or variously ornamented, operculate stone that often has cavities containing resin-like material.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  Herrera et al. (2010, see also 2014a) rejected all fossils placed in this family other than some from South America, and they suggested that Humiriaceae originated there. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">If  the family phylogeny is confirmed (see below), the family characterization above will change considerably; <i>Vantanea</i> in particular is very distinctive morphologically.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Seed Dispersal.</u> The fruits are dispersed by bats or by water, empty cavities in the stone affording bouyancy.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Although D. A. Link is sometimes cited as the author of a paper on the nectaries of Humiriaceae, and he promised such a paper himself, it seems never to have appeared. Some species of <i>Saccoglottis</i> have stamens each with 3 anthers opposite the sepals (Herrera et al. 2010). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some information is taken from Herrera et al. (2010) and Kubitzki (2013b), both general, Mauritzon (1934d: ovules), Herrera et al. (2014a: summary of what is known about  wood anatomy), Narayana and Rao (1977 and references: floral morphology),
Boesewinkel (1985a: ovule and seed),  Bove and Melhem (2000: pollen). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Morphological phylogenetic analyses initially suggested that <i>Vantanea</i> was sister to the other Humiriaceae; it has many stamens in three or more whorls (Bove 1997). Herrera et al. (2010: more detailed morphological analysis of 40 characters) suggested that <i>Vantanea</i> and <i>Humiria</i> were successively sister to the remainder of the family, although support for this topology was weak; the [<i>Humiria</i> + the rest] clade had quincuncial corollas and 30 or fewer stamens with unilocular anthers, the stones often had "resin" cavities, etc..  <i>Schistostemon</i> was sister to the other three genera included (including <i>Vantanea</i>) in a molecular analysis,  but support was weak (Xi et al. 2012b); M. Sun et al. (2016) found that <i>Schistostemon</i>, embeddded in <i>Sacoglottis</i>, was sister to the rest of the family examined, but the interrelationships of the latter were unclear.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Bove (1997) suggested that Ixonanthaceae were sister to Humiriaceae, both having ellagic acid, a "free" annular nectary encircling the ovary, and an undivided style with an entire stigma. Humiriaceae have also been linked with Linaceae and Erythroxylaceae, and thence to Geraniales (Narayana &amp; Rao 1978b), or the three families together are placed in Linales (Cronquist 1981).</p>

(Davis et al. 2005a: note topology), (89-)81, 79(-74)  m.y. (Bell et al. 2011: <i>Ixonanthes</i> also included!), and (104.6-)99.2(-93.1) m.y. (Xi et al. 2012b: Table S7).</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> All six major clades in this group (Malesherbiaceae + Turneraceae + Passifloraceae = Passifloraceae s.l., a single clade) may have diverged in the Cretaceous-Albian 111-100 m.y.a., or a little later (Davis et al. 2005a, details are given for the individual clades), but ages are somewhat younger in Xi et al. (2012b). At the other extreme, Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2001) suggested that many of the clades do not diverge until (well) after 63 m.y. ago.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Larvae of butterflies such as Nymphalidae-Acraeinae and N.-Nymphalinae-Heliconiini, -Vagrantini and -Argynnini commonly eat members of this group (Ehrlich &amp; Raven 1964; see also Arbo 2006; Simonsen 2006; Silva-Brand&atilde;o et al. 2008; Nylin &amp; Wahlberg 2008; etc.); this is also discussed under the individual families below. Some Acraeinae in particular may cue on the presence of the cyanogenic glucoside gynocardin in potential food plants, indeed, that larvae of <i>Acraea horta</i>, which normally ate leaves of  the woody <i>Kiggelaria africana</i>, also ate herbaceous Achariaceae, prompted the successful search for that compound in the latter family (Steyn et al. 2002). Toxic compounds like gynocardin may be sequestered by the larva and passed on to the adult. Interestingly, given the relationships evident in Wurdack and Davis (2008), the distinctive cyclopentenoid glycosides may have to have evolved more than once, and or been lost.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For relationships in this clade (= the parietal clade), which has strong support, see Xi et al. (2012b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For cyclopentenoid cyanogenic glycosides, see e.g. Spencer and Seigler (1984, 1985b) and Spencer et al. (1984) and references. There is much information on seed
anatomy in Takhtajan (1992) while Krosnick et al. (2006) briefly discuss the evolution of polyandry in this group - in some cases, at least, the numerous stamens form a single whorl. See Mauritzon (1936b) for some information on embryology and Furness (2011) for pollen development and ultrastructure.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> It was commonly agreed that the old Flacourtiaceae presented major taxonomic problems. &quot;Flacourtiaceae as a family is only
a fiction; only the tribes are homogeneous&quot; (Hermann Sleumer, a monographer of the family, in Miller 1975: p. 79) - it was indeed a fiction. Some of the old Flacourtiaceae
are now in Achariaceae, a few in Lacistemataceae, while Flacourtiaceae-Berberidopsideae are in Berberidopsidales-Berberidopsidaceae and <i>Aphloia</i> is in
Crossosomatales-Aphloiaceae. The name Flacourtiaceae is now no longer in use, and the remainder of this family is included in Salicaceae. Variation in chemistry, leaf teeth, floral morphology, and seed coat anatomy is largely correlated with this division.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">When parietal placentation was considered to be a very important characters, other families with parietal placentation  such as Caricaceae (Brassicales), Cucurbitaceae (Cucurbitales), etc., might also be grouped here - as the Parietales.</p>

<ul><li>Achariaceae can be recognised by their stipulate leaves, often entire
leaf blades and pulvinate petioles; the crushed leaves may smell quite strongly of cyanide. In the flowers, the number of sepals and petals is often not the
same, and/or the perianth is not simply biseriate, and/or the petals have basal, adaxial scales. The anthers are usually long. The
fruits are often quite large, the placentation is parietal, and the seeds often
have conspicuous vascular bundles in the coat. However, Acharieae in particular can look rather different...</ul>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> The feeding behaviour of Acraeini butterfly larvae are consistent with the family limits adopted here (van Wyk in Dahlgren &amp; van Wyk 1988; Steyn et al. 2002a, 2003 and references). Species of <i>Ryparosa</i> consistently produce glycogen-containing food bodies, and in a number there are associations of varying closeness with ants (Webber et al. 2007).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> There are
large and medium intervascular pits; the wood also has solitary pores and lacks tracheids (Miller 1975). <i>Lindackeria</i> has superficial cork cambium. Pollen variation is considerable (Wendt 1988), as is that in ovule development and seed coat anatomy (Dathan &amp; Singh 1979; van Heel 1973, 1974, 1977, 1979; Steyn et al. 2002a, b, 2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Information is taken from Hegnauer (1966, 1989), chemistry, Datahan and Singh (1979: embryology), Endress and Voser (1975: floral development of <i>Caloncoba</i>), Lemke (1988), Gavrilova (1998: pollen), and Groppo et al. (2010: general); see also Judd
(1997a), Van Wyk in Dahlgren and Van Wyk (1988: Acharieae) and especially Chase et al. (2002). Bernhard and Endress (1999) discuss androecial initiation. Much of the old literature is under Flacourtiaceae! </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> For the circumscription of Achariaceae, see Chase et al.
(2002) and Sosa et al. (2003): It includes Acharieae, Erythrospermeae (<i>Erythrospermum</i> - fibrous
exotegmen), Pangieae (inc. Kiggelarieae), and Lindackerieae (Oncobeae minus <i>Oncoba</i>). The family is divided into three strongly-supported clades, [<i>Hydnocarpus</i> [Erythrospermeae + Lindackerieae]] [Pangieae, Acharieae, <i>Ryparosa</i>, etc.]],  and support for monophyly of the family as a whole is strong. However, Sosa et al. (2003) did not find much support for the last clade. Groppo et al. (2010) questioned some tribal limits in the family and relationships suggested by M. Sun et al. (2016) should also be consulted.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> I have not followed the classification in Chase et al. (2002) since the four tribes recognised there do not map (in terms of monophyly) on to the tree.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> The bulk of Achariaceae had almost
universally been included in Flacourtiaceae s.l. until recently (e.g. Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan
1997). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Botanical Trivia.</b> Immature fruits of Australian <i>Ryparosa</i> have the highest concentrations of cyanogenic glucosides known - 12 mg g<sup>-1</sup> dry weight (Webber &amp; Woodrow 2004).</p>

<ul><li>Goupiaceae may be recognised by their two-ranked leaves with distinctive long-oblong, incurved stipules, ascending secondary veins and scalariform tertiaries. The angled pith is evident even in young plants. The inflorescence is umbellate and the petals are relatively long, and towards the apex they become very narrow and distinctively coloured. The gynoecium has five, widely separated styles; the fruit is a few-seeded berry.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  Diversification in the Goupiaceae clade seems to have slowed down (Xi et al. 2012b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Goupia glabra</i> is a common and sometimes abundant member of the Amazonian tree flora, where it ranks #7 in terms of above-ground biomass and #10 in productivity (ter Steege et al. 2013; Fauset et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Kubitzki (2013b) thought that the node was unilacunar, but Hoyos-G&oacute;mez (2015) found that it was trilacunar, the lateral traces departing from the central stele well before the central trace. It is often
suggested that only seedlings have dentate leaves, those of the adult being
entire, but leaves of flowering specimens are frequently toothed. 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">If Takhtajan (2000) is correct in that there is a lignified endocarp,  the fruit is technically a drupe.</p>

<ul><li>Violaceae may be recognised by their serrate, stipulate
leaves which often dry yellowish and with raised venation; fallen - or even dead leaves still attached to the plant - are quite often skeletized. Their flowers are often spurred and
have stamens with short filaments and very well-developed connectives that closely surround the gynoecium, and their fruit is
often a distinctive loculicidal capsule. The rather large seeds are dispersed explosively
as the fruit wall closes around them and squeezes them out, the three parts of the fruit wall remaining and radiating in a distinctive fashion. Plants are herbs, trees or lianes.</ul>

<ul><li><i>Melicytus</i> is woody,
dioecious, and its fruits are berries; its flowers are almost radially symmetric... Not surprisingly, woody Violaceae are quite commonly often
wrongly identified or not named at all, as Ron Leisner will confirm - however, the vegetative characters mentioned above do help.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  Marcussen et al. (2012, especially 2014) disentangle the complex reticulate history of the polyploid northern hemisphere species of <i>Viola</i> where reticulations as old as ca 29 m.y.a. have been detected; there have been 16-20 or more major alloplyploidization events. There is a radiation of <i>Viola</i> on Hawaii; these are also polyploids and include woody species, and their ancestry is to be sought in west North American species (Marcussen et al. 2012). The genus may have had its origin in Andean South America (Ballard et al. 1998), where the large section <i>Andinum</i>, perhaps one fifth of the genus and including some remarkable rosette- and tussock-forming species, is found along the Andes.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Van Velzen et al. (2015) optimized the evolution of a number of characters for African <i>Rinorea</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> Violaceae are notably common in terms of both numbers of species and individuals with stems at least 10 cm across in the Amazonian tree flora, and they are disproportionally common in the 227 species that make up half the stems in Amazonian forests (ter Steege et al. 2013). <i>Rinorea</i> is common and can dominate in the lower strata of African forests, and  several species may grow together (van Velzen et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Metal hyperaccumulators are quite common in the family, and include both herbaceous and woody members (Brooks 1998 for a summary).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> In the northeast U.S.A. oligolectic bees are notable visitors to <i>Viola</i> (Fowler 2016). Cleistogamy is widespread in this genus.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The largely temperate <i>Viola</i> is myrmecochorous (Lengyel et al. 2010), and myrmecochory, as well as dispersal by larger animals and by wind, also occurs in more tropical taxa.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Violaceae are the preferred food plants for the caterpillars of the majority of fritillaries, Nymphalidae-Argynnini (Simonsen 2006; Nylin et al. 2014). In Africa, perhaps half the species of <i>Cymotho&euml;</i> (ca 75  spp., Nymphalidae-Limenitidinae) occur on <i>Rinorea</i>, and Salicaceae and Kiggelariaceae (= Achariaceae) are also reported to be hosts; although individual species of butterfly and plant may be closely associated, the current geography  of the two may differ from that in the past (McBride et al. 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> <i>Viola tricolor</i>, the pansy, and the related <i>V. arvensis</i> were important subjects of early studies of genetics and speciation.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Inulin has been reported from <i>Hybanthus</i> (Beauvisage 1889); for cyclotides, widely distributed in the family, see Burman et al. (2010). From the description of the root of <i>Ionidium</i> (= <i>Hybanthus</i>) <i>ipecacuanha</i> by Beauvisage (1889), the cork cambium may be mid-cortical or superficial. <i>Viola</i> has storied cambium.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For information on the flowers of <i>Fusispermum</i>, see Cuatrecasas (1950) and Hekking (1984), the former describes the scales as being ventral appendages of the connective.  Feng and Ballard (2005) suggested that even those Violaceae with polysymmetric adult flowers were monosymmetric earlier in development, so "flowers monosymmetric, at least in bud" may be an apomorphy for all/most of the family (see also Arnal 1946 for monosymmetry). The anthers and stigmas of many species are very complex (e.g. Kuta et al. 2012: <i>Viola</i>). In <i>Anchietea</i>
and <i>Decorsella</i> the seeds mature exposed on the open carpels.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Munzinger and Ballard (2003), Hoyos-G&oacute;mez (2015: basal pectinations) and Ballard et al. (2013). An unpublished thesis by Feng (2005) includes a phylogeny of the family and details of the floral development of seven genera. For chemistry, see Hegnauer (1970, 1990), for growth and branching patterns, for pollen morphology, see Mark et al. (2012: <i>Fusispermum</i> has two pollen size classes), and see Hekking (1988) for embryology, etc., Singh (1970), Singh (1963), Singh and Gupta (1967), and Dathan and Singh (1974) for seed anatomy, etc., and Raju (1958) for fruit dehiscence; see also Leins and Erbar (2010: flowers of <i>Viola</i>). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> There is good support for the relationships [<i>Fusispermum</i> [<i>Rinorea apiculata</i> group [<i>Rinorea</i> s. str. [[<i>Viola</i> etc.], [<i>Leonia</i>, etc.], [<i>Melicytus</i>, etc.]]]]] (Tokuoka 2008, see also Feng &amp; Ballard 2005; Ballard et al. 2009; Wahlert &amp; Ballard 2012; esp. Wahlert et al. 2014). The para-/polyphyly of <i>Rinorea</i> is well established, but some major polytomies make it difficult to clarify details of relationships much further. <i>Viola</i> is included in a well-supported clade the other members of which are woody and also have strongly monosymmetric flowers - with the exception of most species of <i>Allexis</i>, which is is sister to the rest of that clade; other taxa with strongly monosymmetric flowers are not immediately related (Wahlert et al. 2014). <i>Hybanthus</i> pops up all over the place in both the <i>Leonia</i> (the type of <i>Hybanthus</i> is there) and <i>Melicytus</i>, but unfortunately relationships in the latter clade are not well understood (Wahlert et al. 2014). Some of the relationships suggested by M. Sun et al. (2016) are somewhat different.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Bakker et al. (2006b), Wahlert and Ballard (2012) and in particular van Velzen et al. (2015) discuss relationships in the speciose African <i>Rinorea</i>, where the clade [<i>R. ?exappendiculata</i> + <i>R. woermanniana</i>] may be sister to the rest of the genus.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> The current infrafamilial classification is insupportable, the large genus <i>Hybanthus</i> is to be cut up into nine genera, perhaps, and <i>Rinorea</i> is also to be divided. Ballard et al. (2013), Wahlert et al. (2014) and Flicker and Ballard (2015) have begun the process of dismemberment.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> An age for this clade may be ca 49.5 m.y. (Muschner et al. 2012).</p>


<ul><li>Turneroideae are herbs to woody plants that may be recognised by their often very
hairy, serrate, exstipulate leaves with strong secondary venation. The flowers, with their calyx and corolla
together forming a tube, contorted and more or less deliquescent yellow or sometimes red corolla, parietal
placentation, and often bifid, fringed stigmas, are distinctive. The loculicidally capsular fruits have
arillate seeds with a minutely and often regularly reticulate testa.</ul>

<ul><li>Malesherbioideae are more or less herbaceous, foetid and often densely glandular-hairy plants with distinctive flowers. The calyx and corolla together form a long tube; the sepals and petals
are both valvate. There is an
androgynophore, the floral tube is persistent in fruit, and the styles are
often subapical on the capsule.</ul>

<ul><li>Many Passifloroideae are tendrillar vines or lianes; the
leaves are stipulate, often with palmate venation, and also often with conspicuous glands on the lamina or
petiole. The axillary buds are
superposed, and the lower bud produces the inflorescence/tendril. The tendril is often oblique
to the axis; a flower may be lateral to it, or paired flowers may be borne on it
or at its base. The
calyx and corolla are often similar and fused to each other at the base, and
there is usually a complex corona. There is a gynophore or androgynophore, often five stamens with large and versatile
anthers, and a three-carpellate gynoecium with parietal placentation. The fruit is often a berry, and the often flattened
seeds are arillate.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u>  The rate of diversification may have increased in Passifloroideae or the [Turneroideae + Passifloroideae] clade (Xi et al. 2012b); Weber and Agrawal (2014) suggested that the evolution of extra-floral nectaries in <i>Turnera</i> was associated with an increase in diversification rates, while extrafloral nectaries may be a key innovation in <i>Passiflora</i> (Krosnick et al. 2011: see also below).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Malesherbia</i> grows in more or less mesic areas to deserts, i.e. areas with &le;50 mm rain/year, in the Atacama-Sechura area of western South America, and are likely to  have invaded the desets ca 20 m.y. after the onset of aridity ca 33 m.y.a. - interestingly, the region has been semiarid, &le;250 mm rain/year, since the Late Jurassic ca 150 m.y.a. (Guerrero et al. 2013). Thulin et al. (2012b) suggest that <i>Mathurina</i>, the only Turneroideae with wind-dispersed seeds, is older than Rodrigues Island, to which it is now restricted. The majority of genera of Turneroideae are African, but include only a few species; most species are New World, most in <i>Turnera</i> itself, and there are three or so links across the South Atlantic; biogeographical relationships, which can be summarized as [[New World -> movement to Old World] [New World (1 species) + Old World]], were obscured by the pre-2012 taxonomy (Thulin et al. 2012b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For androgynophore evolution, see Tokuoka (2012). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> About 625 species of Passifloroideae are vines/lianes of one sort or another (estimate derived from Feuillet &amp; McDougal 2007; see also references in Schnitzer et al. 2015). The tendrils, usually unbranched, spiral in opposite directions along their length reversing atthe perversion (Goriely &amp; Tabor 1998; Gerbode et al. 2012); they twine around their support, although in  some species the tendrils may also be adhesive (Bohn et al. 2015). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the considerable anatomical variation in <i>Adenia</i> as well as variation in life form -  many species have more or less grotesquely swollen stem bases - see Hearn (2006, 2009a). Hearn (2009b) suggested that where vascular strands and associated parenchymatous storage tissue in root and/or stem developed varied in the plant, hence helping to generate the diversity of growth forms in the genus, and  emphasized that transport, support, and storage functions in the plants were semi-independent, perhaps facilitating evolutionary change (Hearn 2013). Leaf morphology also varies considerably in <i>Adenia</i>.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> A complex corona (with a similarly complex terminology) is partcularly conspicuous in <i>Passiflora</i>, and it is variously involved in nectary protection and presentation, tube formation, etc., and a more or less well developed K/C tube with some kind of corona is common in Passifloraceae as a whole. For the pollination of some 37 species of Andean <i>Passiflora</i> supersection <i>Tacsonia</i> by the long-billed hummingbird <i>Ensifera ensifera</i>, see Abrahamczyk et al. (2014: many support values low); the <i>Tacsonia</i> clade is dated to ca 8.4 m.y.a., <i>Ensifera</i> to about a million years more. Sazima and Sazima (1978) note that the bat-pollinated flowers of <i>Passiflora mucronata</i> become zygomorphic as the stamens move after the flowers open (see also Endress and Matthews 2006a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Floral mimicry between <i>Turnera</i> and Malvaceae in Argentina has been suggested (Benitez-Vieyra et al. 2007).  Heterostyly is common in <i>Turnera</i>, <i>Piriqueta</i> and some other  Turneroideae. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Myrmecochory occurs in <i>Turnera</i> (Lengyel et al. 2010), but numerous species of ants playing a variety of roles may be associated with species such as <i>T. ulmifolia</i> (Rico-Gray &amp; Oliveira 2007 and references); wind dispersal may occur when the aril is fimbriate (Arbo et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> The cyclopentenoid glycosides common in Passifloraceae may be sequestered
by caterpillars feeding on the plants and perhaps used in defence and/or even as
nitrogen sources; Achariaceae also have such glycosides.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Caterpillars of <i>Heliconius</i> butterflies (Nymphalidae) use <i>Passiflora</i> and its relatives as their main food source (Fordyce 2010 for references and diversification rates). The plants show great variation in leaf morphology and foliar glands. Some of the glands are egg mimics (Vanderplank 2007 for references) and/or are epithelial extrafloral nectaries and may attract ants that defend the plants (Krosnick et al. 2011 for a summary). Butterflies lay eggs on plants that lack eggs, hence the egg mimicry. Heliconiine butterflies may have diversified on the foothills and lower slopes of the eastern Andes from Peru northwards (Rosser et al. 2012). <i>Heliconius</i> butterflies themselves are also closely associated with <i>Psiguria</i> (Cucurbitaceae) and relatives, and perhaps some other plants, which they pollinate; unusually, the pollen is a source of nutrients for the butterfly. Ages of the main protagonists: Ca 40.5 m.y. for crown <i>Passiflora</i> (Muschner et al. 2012); </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The larvae of some Acraeinae, also nymphalids, and also of brightly-coloured Notodontidae-Dioptininae (moths) are also often found on <i>Passiflora</i> (Miller 1992; Silva-Brand&atilde;o et al. 2008), and at least the former are also found on <i>Barteria</i>. Turneroideae are the hosts of caterpillars of several genera of Nymphalidae, alternate hosts include Salicaceae, Passifloroideae, and Violaceae (Arbo 2006 and references).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Details of the association between the African ant-plant <i>Bartera fistulosa</i> and the ant <i>Tetraponera aethiops</i> are given by Dejean et al. (2008). The evolution of this association, which involves all four species of <i>Barteria</i> and both specialist and generalist species of ants, is complex (Peccoud et al. 2012), and it is ascomycete fungi inhabiting the domatia that are an immediate source of nitrogen for the ant (Blatrix et al. 2012).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> For the PEP subunit &alpha; <i>rpo</i>A gene in <i>Passiflora</i>, see Blazier et al. (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Species of Turneroideae have biparental or
paternal transmission of plastids, as may also species of Passifloroideae (Shore et al.
1994).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Cyanogenic glycosides in this family are diverse and have a variety of precursors, both protein and non-protein amino acids  (Miller et al. 2006 for references). See also Spencer and Seigler (1985a: Malesherbioideae), Spencer et al. (1985: Turneroideae) and Spencer and Seigler (1984, 1987, and references: Passifloreae).</p> 


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Do the sieve tubes have non-dispersive protein bodies? Anatomically, the old Flacourtiaceae-Paropsieae (<i>Barteria</i>, <i>Paropsia</i>, etc.) and Passifloreae (Chase et al. 2002) are rather similar, indeed, the major variation in Passifloroideae seems to be associated with habit - lianes versus trees (Ayensu &amp; Stern 1964). <i>Passiflora</i> and its immediate relatives have stem collenchyma, cymose inflorescences, and branches developing from an accessory (superposed) bud; accessory buds are common in taxa that have axillary tendrils with non-basal prophyllar buds. In Passifloreae these prophyllar buds may produce additional tendrils, as in the branched tendrils of <i>Passiflora</i> subgenus <i>Deidamioides</i>), and/or flowers. There is some debate as to whether the tendril is the pedicel of a terminal flower or the ?axial terminus of the inflorescence (Prenner 2014). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Cronquist (1981) suggested that Malesherbioideae lacked
stipules. In species of <i>Passiflora</i>
with strongly bilobed leaves, vernation may be modified conduplicate: The blade
makes a V with an inverted V at the end of each arm. The tendril is an axillary shoot and flowers - single, or 3-flowered cymes - can arise from
the prophyllar buds on it. For the floral and extrafloral nectaries of Passifloraceae, see Krosnick et al. (2008a, b, 2011). The latter are anatomically quite different from the former (i.a. they lack nectarostomata) and the <i>CRABS CLAW</i> gene is not expressed in them (Krosnick et al. 2008a), and so they are arguably not "homologous". </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a survey of floral morphology in Turneroideae, see Arbo et al. (2015); some species of both <i>Turnera</i>
and <i>Piriqueta</i> have epiphyllous flowers. Monosymmetric flowers, with stamens, etc., adaxially positioned, are found in species of <i>Passiflora</i> like <i>P. ampullacea</i>, and at least sometimes here the odd sepal is abaxial (Macdougal 1994: there are also four carpels); <i>P. unipetala</i> has but a single petal in the adaxial position. Although the tubular flowers of Passifloraceae s.l. are often described as having a hypanthium, the floral tube is nearly always formed from calycine and corolline elements only.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A little is known about the development of the complex series of fimbriae and membranes at the base of the androgynophore and in the throat of the KC tube in <u>Passiflora</u>. In subgenus <u>Passiflora</u> at least, genes normally involved in stamen development are expressed in the centripetally developing fimbriae, although the limen, a rim structure at the base of the androgynophore protecting the nectar, is from this point of view an organ <i>sui generis</i> (Hemingway et al. 2011). These fimbriae are unlikely to be staminodia (Prenner 2014: <i>P. lobata</i>). Cla&szlig;en-Bockhoff and Meyer (2016) also discuss the development of the corona, and  Bernhard (1999) looks at similar structures here and in other Passifloreae.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The styles of Malesherbioideae are shown as being commissural by
Schnizlein (1843-1870: fam. 198). For a discussion on aril development, see Kloos and Bouman (1980); although the aril is often described as funicular, they incline to call it raphal. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Adenia</i> seems rather different from other Passifloroideae, perhaps being more like the two other subfamilies, as in having an only moderately developed corona and tricolporate pollen (e.g. see Feuillet &amp; MacDougal 2006). <i>Adenia</i>  also has a nectary often made up of
separate glands, a hollow style, and its stigma lacks multicellular papillae
(Bernhard 1999a, c), in addition, it may be dioecious, it lacks an
androgynophore but may have a gynophore, its stamens are sometimes connate, and
some species have a true hypanthium (de Wilde 1971b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Embryologically Malesherbioideae are largely unknown.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Turneraceae were weakly associated with Malesherbiaceae in Chase et al. (2002), the two being strongly associated with Passifloraceae.  Korotkova et al. (2009: only three taxa from the three families) found that <i>Turnera</i> and <i>Passiflora</i> were sister and with 98% jacknife support. Preliminary data seemed to suggest that a paraphyletic Passifloraceae might include Turneraceae and Malesherbiaceae (A.P.G. II 2003), but Tokuoka (2012), Xi et al. (2012b), M. Sun et al. (2016), etc., obtain the basic relationships shown above.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Thulin et al. (2012b) disentangled relationships within Turneroideae, finding a largely Old World and a largely New World clade (see above). Relationships are [[<i>Adenoa</i> [<i>Piriquetia</i> + <i>Turnera</i>]] [<i>Erblichia</i> [African and malagasy clade]]] (see also Tokuoka 2012; Sun et al. 2016: <i>Stapfiella</i> a little migratory). Arbo and Espert (2009: morphological analysis, basally pectinate tree with little support) discuss the morphology and biogeography of <i>Turnera</i>; relationships suggested by a later study with 91 characters, including several from the seed, were rather different that those apparent in molecular analyses (Arbo et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> For relationships within Malesherbioideae, see Gengler-Novak (2002, 2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Tokuoka (2012) clarified the phylogeny of Passifloroideae, only <i>Paropsiopsis</i> was not included. Paropsieae are monophyletic, with [<i>Paropsia</i> + <i>Viridivia</i>] being sister to the rest (see also Sun et al. 2016). Within Passifloreae relationships were [<i>Adenia</i> [[<i>Dilkea</i>, <i>Passiflora</i>, etc.] [<i>Basananthe</i>, <i>Deidamia</i>, etc.]]] (Tokuoka 2012; see also Sun et al. 2016). In earlier studies, e.g. Krosnick and Freudenstein (2005), the position of <i>Adenia</i> was unclear.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a phylogeny of <i>Passiflora</i>, see Yockteng and Nadot (2004), Krosnick and Freudenstein (2005: also morphology), Krosnick and Freudenstein (2006) and  Muschner et al. (2012: outline only). Krosnick et al. (2013: inc. much information) discuss the phylogeny of <i>Passiflora</i> subgenus <i>Decaloba</i> and Hearn (2006) provides a phylogeny for <i>Adenia</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Including Turneraceae and Malesherbiaceae in Passifloraceae s.l. was an optional arrangement in A.P.G. II (2003), and because of the basic similarity of the three families, they were combined in A.P.G. III (2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Passiflora</i> includes <i>Hollrungia</i> and <i>Tetrapathea</i> (Krosnick &amp; Freudenstein 2006); for a formal infrageneric classification of <i>Passiflora</i>, see Feuillet and Macdougal (2004). For genera in Turneroideae, see  Thulin et al. (2012b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Crown-group Lacistemataceae are around (49.3-)19.8(-2.6) m.y.o. (Xi et al. 2012b: table S7, inc. Los.).</p>

<ul><li>Lacistemataceae are woody, evergreen plants that have stipulate and usually serrate leaves. The small flowers are borne in rather dense racemes to spikes and have an inconspicuous perianth and a single anther whose two thecae are often well separated and even stipitate. The dehiscent fruit is small, with one, sometimes up to three, apical seeds.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The inflorescence may be derived from a more elborate form with determinate branches. Chirtoi&uuml; (1918) described the flower as having 4-5 free perianth parts and an irregularly lobed , annular nectary. The presence of an aril in Lacistemataceae needs to be confirmed (see also Corner 1976).  Sleumer (1980) records an aril in <i>Lacistema</i>, but a fleshy seed coat for <i>Lozania</i>.  In <i>Lozania</i> there appear to be long "hairs" inside the fruit which perhaps support the dangling seed; these hairs are thick-walled but unlignified cells that may be derived from the funicle (see also <i>Casearia</i>, Salicaceae). The embryology, etc., of the family remain largely unknown</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Additional information is taken from: <i>Lozania</i> - <i>Riviere 270</i> (anatomy), <i>Gentry et al. 22231</i> (fruit); <i>Lacistema</i> - <i>Aymard &amp; Delgado 6882</i> (fruit), <i>Rimachi Y. 11201</i> (anatomy - stomata tending to anisocytic). See Young (2007 onwards: <a href="javascript:showImage('http://www.lacistemataceae.org/',600,500)">Lacistemataceae website</a>, focus is on  species, nomenclature, etc..</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Lacistemataceae did not cluster with the rest of
Salicaceae and Kiggelariaceae in an early study by Savolainen et al. (2000a), although they were probably in this area (Chase et al. 2002; see also D. Soltis et al. 1999, 2000). Davis et al. (2005a) place them as sister to Salicaceae s.l. (61% bootstrap, 1.0 posterior probability), as do Korotkova et al. (2009: slightly higher jacknife); as might be expected, they lack salicoid teeth.</p>

<ul><li>Salicaceae can be recognised by their alternate,
serrate, stipulate leaves that often have distinctive "salicoid teeth"; these latter have a small vein proceeding into the tooth, where it expands, the apex of the tooth being a variously coloured spherical gland or stout hair. The flowers often have many spreading stamens and a
commonly three-carpellate gynoecium with parietal placentation and either
separate styles or a long, persistent style; the fruit is often a capsule. When there are both sepals and petals, the two whorls are in a regular
alternating arrangement, and the nectar glands or annular nectary are often outside the stamens. A number of
taxa have pellucid foliar glands.</ul>

<ul><li><i>Scyphostegia</i> is distinctive florally in its long-lived inflorescences with overlapping tubular bracts that are somewhat reminiscent of those of <i>Alpinia</i> sect. <i>Myriocrater</i>; its 3-merous flowers have connate tepals.</li></ul>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Boucher et al. (2003) described  <i>Pseudosalix</i>, a ca 48 m.y.o. Eocene fossil from North America, which is morphologically intermediate between <i>Salix</i> and more florally conventional Salicaceae, with a terminal, branched inflorescence and flowers with well developed sepals. <i>Populus</i> leaves are known from deposits of ca 59 m.y.o. in the western U.S.A. (Wing 1987).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Diversification in Scyphostegioideae seems to have slowed down (!: Xi et al. 2012b: as Scyphostegiaceae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Salix</i> and <i>Populus</i> are often ectomycorrhizal and grow with other ectomycorhizal trees in boreal forests. In Alaska the leaves of <i>Populus balsamifera</i>, for example, are rich in condensed tannins, and pentamers and above of these tannins complexed nitrogen, already at low concentrations, in the humic layers of the soil, so making it unavailable for many plants  (Fierer et al. 2001). Indeed, the ectomycorrhizal white spruce (<i>Pica glauca</i> dominated in the next stage of the succession (Fierer et al. 2001). <i>Salix</i> itself is a major component of the biomass in tundra ecosystems (Chapin &amp; K&ouml;rner 1995); with almost 70 species growing in the Arctic, it is the second largest genus there (Elven et al. 2011). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A single clone of <i>Populus tremuloides</i> is recorded as covering 43.6 ha and has around 47,000 stems (DeWoody et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Metal hyperaccumulators (nickel) are notably common in members of the family growing in New Caledonia (Brooks 1998 for a summary).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> <i>Populus</i> is dioecious and wind-pollinated. However, in the northeast U.S.A., at least, oligolectic bees are perhaps rather surprisingly notable visitors to <i>Salix</i> (Fowler 2016).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Boeckler et al. (2011) discuss the anti-herbivore properties of the phenolic glycosides, salicinoids, characteristic of <i>Salix</i> and its immediate relatives, and sometimes up to 30% of dry weight (Pentzold et al. 2014 and references). Despite this protection, a number of insects and fungi live on them. Around 34 species of <i>Phyllonorycter</i> leaf-mining moths (Lepidoptera-Gracillariidae-Phyllocnistinae) are found on <i>Populus</i> and <i>Salix</i> in the Holarctic region (Lopez Vaamonde et al. 2006). Caterpillars of <i>Atella</i> (Nymphalinae) fed on the old Flacourtiaceae and Salicaceae (Ehrlich &amp; Raven 1964) as do several Vagrantini (Nylin et al. 2014), while some Notodontidae moths (Miller 1992) show similar host patterns. The amount of condensed tannins in the leaves may vary greatly, but the implications of this for plant defence are unclear (Barbehenn &amp; Constabel 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There has been a remarkable radiation - 400-500 species - of  euurine  sawflies (Hymenoptera-Tenthredinidae-Nematinae), mostly gallers but also folding or rolling leaves, on <i>Salix</i> and <i>Populus</i>, although they have yet to be recorded from other Salicaceae. Leaf folding appears to be the primitive condition, and the sawflies show considerable host specificity (Roininen et al. 2005; Nyman et al. 1998, 2006 and references); high diversity and high host specificity are not commonly correlated in Lepidoptera, at least (Menken et al. 2009). Unlike other galls, sawfly-induced galls result largely from stimuli provided by the ovipositing wasp, which may inject fluids into the plant, rather than from the activities of the larvae, so the galls assume their mature forms before the eggs hatch (Redfern 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> <i>Salix</i> and its immediate relatives enter into a variety of associations with both ectomycorrhiza1 and endomycorrhizal fungi, and dark septate endophytes have also been found on them (e.g. Gardes &amp; Dahlberg 1996; Van der Heijden 2000; Becerra et al. 2009; Bennett et al. 2017: Supplementary Material). Tedersoo et al. (2013) found a strong correlation between host and ECM community composition and species richness in <i>Salix</i> and <i>Populus</i> - and in a small sample of less closely related hosts.  <i>Melampsora</i> spp. are found on <i>Salix</i>, <i>M. idesiae</i> on <i>Idesia</i> (Holm 1979).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> A genome duplication in the common ancestor of <i>Salix</i> and <i>Populus</i>, the salicoid duplication, has been dated to 65-60 m.y. (Tuskan et al. 2006); it will be interesting to know if other Salicaceae have it. This duplication has also been dated to (36.3-)34.7(-32.6) m.y.a., although the oldest known fossils of this clade (of <i>Populus</i>) are 47.4 m.y.o. (Vanneste et al. 2014a and references; see also above); Jiang et al. (2013) followed the fate of duplicated genes and Garsmeur et al. (2013) suggested that the duplication may have been an autoploid event. Note that Murat et al. (2015b) date a duplication in <i>Populus</i> to 17-7 m.y.a., overall chromosome number changes in Salicaceae being x = 12 &rarr; 24 &rarr; 19 (<i>Populus</i>). <i>Populus</i> has lost the <i>PHYC</i> gene (Matthews 2010 and references); again, the phylogenetic extent of this loss is of interest.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The [Salix + <i>Populus</i>] clade is dioecious, and  an X/Y sex determination system has evolved at least three times (twice in <i>Populus</i>) here, maybe within the last 7-6 m.y. - although the whole clade is  at least 25 m.y.o. (Geraldes et al. 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Salix</i> in particular is notorious for its extensive interspecific hybridisation. The closely-related <i>Populus balsamifera</i> and <i>P. trichocarpa</i> introgress at contact zones and are estimated to be ca 75,000 y.o. from nuclear data - and 6-15 <b>m.</b>y.o. from chloroplast data - perhaps chloroplast capture from a ghost lineage (Huang et al. 2014)? DNA barcoding failed spectacularly in <i>Salix</i>, and although 2-7 plastid genome regions were examined, only 1 of 71 species was successfully barcoded (Percy et al. 2014, q.v. for explanations).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Banara</i> is the only genus of Salicaceae
reported to have cyanogenic glycosides, and it is well embedded within
the family (Chase et al. 2002). The perforation plates of the tracheary elements are more or less
simple and the intervascular pits are small. Variation in tension wood cell morphology is described by Ghislain et al. (2016); the regaining of normal cell wall anatomy in a group of genera that includes <i>Salix</i> and <i>Idesia</i> may be an apomorphy there. <i>Xylosma</i>, <i>Flacourtia</i>, etc., have
groups of large sclereids in the phloem (Zahur 1959). <i>Xylosma</i> and some <i>Casearia</i> seem to have unilacunar
nodes, while leaf traces arise an internode
below the leaf they innervate in <i>Hasseltia</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Salicoid leaf teeth are quite variable, but all have secretory palisade cells over parenchyma and are well supplied by vascular tissue, especially xylem (Wilkinson 2007). Thadeo et al. (2008; see also Thadeo &amp; Meira 2009) discuss the similarity between leaf teeth and foliar nectaries in Salicaceae, in particular the foliar nectaries of <i>Prockia crucis</i> that secrete fructose, glucose, sucrose, etc. Nectaries at the base of the lamina in two species of <i>Populus</i> differed markedly. In one they were persistent, with continuous nectar flow, while in another, large amounts of nectar were produced over a short time and cell death occurred, but new nectaries could be produced (Escalante-P&eacute;rez et al. 2012). The deciduous glandular portion of the theoid leaf teeth of <i>Casearria</i> have been compared with colleters (Fernandes et al. 2016), and so that part of the family would thus be included in any list of groups that had colleters</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Branching in <i>Casearia</i> is phyllanthoid, the orthotropic axes having spirally arranged and reduced leaves while the plagiotropic branches are sylleptic and have fully-expanded and two-ranked leaves. <i>Abatia</i>
has opposite leaves with at most very small stipules and marginal glands at the
base of the lamina. There are also taxa with pli-nerved leaf blades and foliar
glands - Salicaceae are vegetatively rather heterogeneous.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For inflorescence development in catkinate Salicaceae and genera like <i>Idesia</i>, see  Cronk et al. (2015). The valvate perianth members of <i>Abatia</i> are basally connate and bear
many filamentous processes, and the flowers lack a nectary. In those species that have a nectary, its morphology is very variable. It is often
made up of a number of lobes. It has been claimed that the nectary of <i>Salix</i> represents a perianth member, but Alford et al. (2009) suggest that it is like that of other members of the family; there are receptacular nectaries adaxial to the stamens in taxa in the clade sister to [<i>Salix</i> + <i>Populus</i>] while in <i>Poliothyrsus</i> it is outside the stamens and is on the bases of the valvate perianth members. Elongated embryo sacs occur in both Salicaceae and old Flacourtiaceae (Steyn et al. 2005a), indeed,  the embryo sac more or less protrudes into the micropyle in <i>Archevaletaia</i> (Maheshwari 1950). Corner (1976) described the micropyle of <i>Scyphostegia</i> as being exostomal. The exotegmen of <i>Dovyalis</i> consists of ribbon-like cells.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Much older literature is under Flacourtiaceae: See Lemke (1988), Judd
(1997a), Chase et al. (2002), and Alford and Dement (2015: Samydoideae),all general information, Hegnauer (1973, 1990, also 1966, 1989), Spencer and Seigler
(1985b) and Chai (2009), all chemistry,  Miller (1975: wood anatomy), Bernhard and Endress (1999: androecial initiation), Gavrilova (1998: pollen), and Narayanaswami and Sawhney (1959) and Steyn et al. (2004, 2005a, b), all ovule and seed development, summary in latter paper) and van Heel
(1977, 1979: testa anatomy).  For <i>Scyphostegia</i>, see Metcalfe (1954: anatomy), van Heel (1967a: flowers and fruits) and Hutchinson (1973: different interpretations of the gynoecium). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Chase et al.
(2002) greatly clarified the phylogenetic situation in the old Salicaceae-Flacourtiaceae area (see also Judd 1997a; Nandi et al. 1998; T. Azuma et al. 2000; Savolainen et al. 2000a), although sampling within tribes still needs to be
extended. Three main clades (as subfamilies above) were recognized (see also M. Sun et al. 2016 for relationships within the subfamilies).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Casearia</i>, which lacks salicoid leaf teeth and has apetalous flowers with a nectariferous area on the basal-adaxial surface of the perianth tube, is sister to the
rest of Salicaceae, although support for this position is weak (Chase et al. 2002; Xi et al. 2012b, c.f. D. Soltis et al. 1999, 2000).   <i>Trichostephanus</i> (Trichostephaneae) was
not assigned to any family (Chase et al. 2002), but in lacking petals and in having a disc at the base of the calyx it is like <i>Casearia</i> (Samydeae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In gross morphology <i>Oncoba</i> is remarkably like other members of the erstwhile Oncobeae, but they differ in chemistry, leaf tooth type, and stamen initiation and are now in Achariaceae-Lindackerieae; <i>Oncoba</i> itself is perhaps to be assigned to Flacourtieae. Xi et al. (2012b) found the relationships [<i>Flacourtia</i> + <i>Prockia</i>] [<i>Poliothyrsis</i> + <i>Salix</i> and relatives]].</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For relationships of <i>Salix</i> and its immediate relatives, see Leskinen and Alstr&ouml;m-Rapaport (1999). Relationships are [<i>Microhasseltia</i>, etc. [[<i>Salix</i> + <i>Populus</i>] [<i>Olmediella</i> [<i>Bennettiodendron</i> + <i>Idesia</i>]]]; characters like hairy seeds, sepals deciduous in fruit, loss of corolla, and dioecy are apomorphies at various levels within this clade (Alford et al. 2009). X. Liu et al. (2016) recovered the quite well supported relationships [<i>Poliothyrsis</i> [[<i>Bennettiodendron</i> + <i>Idesia</i>] [<i>Salix</i> + <i>Populus</i>]]]. This clade was sister to a clade in which seven members of both Scolopieae and Saliceae (see above) were variously combined, but no other Salicaceae were examined.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For a phylogeny of <i>Salix</i>, see T. Azuma et al. (2000) and J.-H. Chen et al. (2010), also X. Liu et al. (2016 and references); L. Zhang et al. (2016) provide a chloroplast (maternal) sectional phylogeny of <i>Populus</i>.</p>

<ul><li><i>Salix</i> and <i>Populus</i>: plants ectomycorrhizal; salicinoids +; cuticle waxes as rosettes of platelets, or 0; inflorescence a
catkin; P much reduced; <u>G [2]</u>, collateral, ovules usu. unitegmic; seeds
with long placental hairs at base; embryo chlorophyllous. These are mostly derived features.</li></ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b>  Alford (2003) recognised three families for the New World genera previously included in Flacourtiaceae and here included in Salicaceae. Chase et al. (2002) provide a detailed tribal classification for the clade, and most are mentioned above. However, tribal limits may well have to be adjusted, thus Saliceae have been expanded and Flacourtieae may be  polyphyletic, etc.. A more detailed phylogeny is much needed. <i>Oncoba</i>,a spiny shrub with sepals and petals quite distinct, the latter twice as many as the former, long style, and numerous, centrifugal stamens, is unplaced.</p>



<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Generic limits in the <i>Casearia</i> group neeed attention (Samarakoon et al. 2010). Applequist (2017) provided a sectional classification for the large genus <i>Homalium</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> It had been observed in the past that Salicaceae s.
str. and Flacourtiaceae-Idesieae were close, despite the catkins of the former (summary in Chase et al. 2002) - they both have similar, distinctive leaf teeth,
phenolic-type compounds such as salicin, etc. (Miller 1975), and rusts and caterpillars, perhaps keying in on chemical characters, show similar distributions (e.g. Meeuse 1975b; see above). However, in the Englerian system <i>Salix</i> was often kept with the wind-pollinated Amentiferae, not at all close to Flacourtiaceae, a family that was also recognised at the time and which encompassed the bulk of Salicaceae above and also Achariaceae, etc.; see also Gilg's (1914) emphatic rejection of Hallier's suggestion that there might be a link between <i>Idesia</i> (Flacourtiaceae) and Salicaceae. Cronquist (1981) placed Salicaceae in a monofamilial order, but next to his Violales.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> This node has been dated to (74-)71, 69(-66) m.y. (Wikstr&ouml;m et al. 2001), ca 82.8 m.y. (Tank et al. 2015: table S1, S2) and (111.3-)106.9(-103.1) m.y. (Xi et al. 2012b: table S7).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Lee et al. (2011) found that genes involved in oxygen and radical detoxification clustered at this node, but <i>Populus</i> and <i>Bruguiera</i> were the only other members of Malpighiales in their study.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">On strict parsimony grounds the distinctive fruits of Euphorbiaceae, etc., could be a synapomorphy for the whole clade or acquired twice, in any case, they have been lost several times within Euphorbiaceae s. str., etc..</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Many older works on Euphorbiaceae contain information about Euphorbiaceae, Peraceae, Phyllanthaceae and/or Picrodendraceae, not to mention other small segregate families. See e.g. Michaelis (1924: floral morphology), Webster (1967, 1994a, b - also other papers
in <i>Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard.</i> 81. 1994 - and 2013), Radcliffe-Smith and Esser (2001), general, inc. generic descriptions, etc.), Hegnauer (1966, 1989: chemistry), etc..</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b>  Merino Sutter and Endress (1995) argue for
a rather broadly delimited Euphorbiaceae (inc. both Phyllanthaceae and
Putranjivaceae), Huber (1991) for a narrower circumscription, with the
biovulate taxa (Phyllanthaceae, Picrodendraceae,
Putranjivaceae) being considered to be closer to Linales s. str., while Meeuse
(1990) also suggested that the family should be split - into eleven families. There is no molecular evidence yet for a broadly delimited Euphorbiaceae (unless Linaceae et al. were to be included), yet Euphorbiaceae s. str, Phyllanthaceae and Picrodendraceae all have a similar and rather distinctive capsule, etc. (see also Merino Sutter et al. 2006). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Indeed, molecular analyses by Wurdack and Chase (2002), and especially by Wurdack et al. (2005, see also Tokuoka 2007) and Xi et al. (2012b), suggested that substantial changes were needed to the groupings that had been recognised in the family. The reclassification they proposed is followed here, with the interpolation of Rafflesiaceae (see Davis et al. 2007) and the associated recognition of Peraceae. Splitting Peroideae from the other Euphorbiaceae s. str. - which actually makes the latter more homogeneous in fruit and testa anatomy - and keeping Rafflesiaceae seems reasonable, there being little enthusiasm for including a Rafflesioideae within an already large Euphorbiaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Note that all the features mentioned above are lost in Rafflesiaceae, clearly a very derived group. Dioecy may be ancestral here, but with subsequent reversions to monoecy (K&auml;fer et al. 2014) - but in this case, <u>not</u> in Rafflesiaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The extremes of flower size in angiosperms are to be found in this clade. Pseudanthia have evolved ca 4 times, and in <i>Euphorbia</i>, for example, a single stamen represents the staminate flower. In <i>Rafflesia</i>, on the other hand, the flower can be up to 1.5 m across (e.g. Barkman et al. 2008).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Seed Dispersal.</u> Esser (2003b) emphasized that over 50% of Malesian Euphorbiaceae s.l. were zoochorous, notably more than in other tropical areas.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For pseudanthial bracts in Peraceae and Euphorbiaceae, see Gagliardi et al. (2016. The exotegmen in Rafflesiaceae is described as having U-shaped thickenings, and the exotegmen of some Peraceae can also look U-shaped in transverse section (see illustrations in Tokuoka &amp; Tobe 2003).</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Neither wood anatomy nor pollen morphology are distinctive (Nowicke et al. 1998; Hayden &amp; Hayden 2000), however, members of Peraceae are variously described as having lysigenous radial canals in the wood, laticiferous cells, or elongated cells with brown contents. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The highly reduced flowers of <i>Pera</i> are surrounded by coloured inflorescence bracts; a pseudanthium of sorts. <i>Pogonophora</i> has adaxially barbellate petals. Style branches are variable in this group, being very short to longer and bifid. The seeds are described as having arils by Tokuoka and Tobe (2003). The anatomy of the seed coat of Peraceae is distinctive compared to that of Euphorbiaceae s. str. - this from an earlier version of /APweb/: "Tokuoka and Tobe (2003) note some Acalyphoideae with a distinctive seed coat anatomy - a more or less tracheoidal exotegmen - unlike that of all other Euphorbiaceae (minus Phyllanthaceae, etc).  Interestingly, all the taxa involved belong to other families or are in Euphorbiaceae-Peroideae.  These are sister to other Euphorbiaceae, and the distinctive exotegmen structure is more like that common in other Malpighiales.  So it is possible that this is plesiomorphic, whereupon the palisade exotegmen of <i>Pogonophora</i> is a parallelism..."  The seed coat anatomy of <i>Trigonopleura</i> is unknown.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information, see Webster (1984, 2013) and Radcliffe Smith (2001), for wood anatomy, see Hayden and Hayden (2000), and for pollen, see Nowicke et al. (1998); for seed coat anatomy, see Huner (1991) and Tokuoka and Tobe (2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Many details of anatomy, and in particular floral development, ovule morphology, etc., are poorly known.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Tokuoka and Tobe (2006) question the inclusion of <i>Pogonophora</i> in this clade; indeed, if it is to be included and is sister to other Peraceae, then mapping seed coat evolution on the tree does become a bit tricky.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Although Airy Shaw (1976) recognised Peraceae as separate from Euphorbiaceae, his Peraceae included only <i>Pera</i>, a genus long considered very distinctive within Euphorbiaceae, even if rarely separated from it.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b>  The age of crown-group Rafflesiaceae has been estimated at (95.9-)81.7(-69.5) m.y.a.  (Bendiksby et al. 2010; see also Barkman et al. 2008).</p> 


<ul><li>Rafflesiaceae are stem or root
parasites on <i>Tetrastigma</i> (Vitaceae) and lack leaves, stems and roots. The large to massive flowers are usually imperfect and have an often apparently uniseriate and basally-fused perianth; there are 12-40 extrorse stamens adnate to
a central column in the staminate flowers and the carpellate flowers have an inferior ovary.</ul>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> If <i>Sapria</i> split off from other Rafflesiaceae ca 81.7 m.y.a. (Bendiksby et al. 2010) there must have been a major reorganization of the plant body in less than 15 m.y. after the Rafflesiaceae and Euphorbiaceae s. str. clades diverged; holoparasitism must have been established by then. This also raises the issue of when lowland tropical rainforest evolved. Today it is the preferred habitat of Rafflesiaceae as well as many echlorophyllous mycoheterotrophic taxa such as Burmanniaceae, Thismiaceae (<a href="dioscorealesweb.htm#BurDio" target="home">Dioscoreales</a>), Gentianaceae-Voyrieae (<a href="gentianalesweb.htm#Voyrieae" target="home">Gentianales</a>), etc.. However, the dates in Naumann et al. (2013, q.v. for discussion), with the <u>stem</u> age being around 65.3 m.y.a., suggest a rather different scenario. Bendiksby et al. (2010, q.v. for more dates; see also Barkman et al. 2008) suggested that diversification within the genera of Rafflesiaceae did not begin until very much after the origin of the clade. <i>Rhizanthes</i> and <i>Rafflesia</i> may have separated ca 37 m.y.a. (Naumann et al. 2013), while crown-group <i>Rafflesia</i> may be a mere (15.1-)11.8(-9.2) m.y.o., and this is the oldest of the crown-group ages suggested - perhaps there was an extinction event immediately prior to this. </p> 

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">P. Chen et al. (2011b: HPD) suggest ages of (65.3-)50.6(-36.4) m.y. for stem <i>Tetrastigma</i>, (49.3-)36.9(-25.7) m.y. for the crown group, well before diversification of <i>Rafflesia</i>; ages in Lu et al. (2013) are somewhat older, at (67.7-)57.4(-47.4) and (59.4-)47.6(-36.4) m.y. respectively, while a mere ca 29.6 and 17.2 m.y. are the ages in Adams et al. (2016). If the whole family has always been an obligate parasitic of <i>Tetrastigma</i>, there are again interesting timing problems. Fruits of crown-group Vitaceae from the Deccan Traps have been dated to around/a little before the K/C boundary ca 66 m.y.a. (Manchester et al. 2013). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Rafflesia</i> - Rafflesiaceae in general - are parasitic on species of <i>Tetrastigma</i> <a href="vitalesweb.html#Vitaceae" target="home">(Vitaceae)</a>, an association that may have evolved more than once (P. Chen et al. 2011a). However, although some of the mitochondrial genes that have moved into Rafflesiaceae place them as sister to Vitaceae, others group with Cucurbitaceae and even <i>Daucus</i> (Apiaceae). This may suggest that the hosts of Rafflesiaceae may have been rather different in the past (Xi et al. 2013a). In a quite extensive study, all the hosts of the eleven species of <i>Rafflesia</i> in the Philippines examined were <i>Tetrastigma</i> - 6/8 species there - but there was not much host specificity (Pelser et al. 2016). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The vegetative plant body of Rafflesiaceae is endophytic, and Wurdack and Davis (2009) suggested that it might be derived from laticiferous tissue, however, the common ancestor of Euphorbiaceae and Rafflesiaceae is unlikely to have had laticifers. The endophyte is quite inconspicuous, almost filamentous, and the cells are undifferentiated (Nikolov et al. 2014b). The parasite obtains all its nutrients from the host. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> The flowers of at least some Rafflesiaceae are thermogenic (Seymour 2001) and pollination, where known, is by flies, the flowers looking and smelling rather like a rotting carcass and the pollen being presented in the form of a slurry, as occurs in other fly-pollinated flowers (B&auml;nziger 2004; Davis et al. 2008; Nikolov et al. 2014a; see also J&uuml;rgens et al. 2013  for this syndrome). The ca 79-fold increase in flower size during the evolution of stem-group Rafflesiaceae over a period of ca 46 m.y. may be linked to the adoption of sapromyophily; size increase in the subsequent ca 60 m.y. was much more modest  (Davis et al. 2007, 2008). However, in a more extensive study of <i>Rafflesia</i>, Barkman et al. (2008) suggested that there had been very considerable changes in flower size even within the last 12 m.y. or so, the age of crown group <i>Rafflesia</i>, with repeated both considerable increases and moderate decreases in flower size. A\The ancestral flower size was (very approximately) 29 cm across (Barkman et al. 2008), and the largest flowers are about 1 m across (<i>R. arnoldii</i>) while those of <i>R. consueloae</i> are the smallest at around 10 cm across, although the perianth lobes are erect (Galindon et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The seeds are embedded in ?placental tissue and the fruits may be eaten by rats (B&auml;nziger 2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> Davis and Wurdack (2004) found that the sequence of the mitochondrial gene <i>nad1</i>B-c In Rafflesiaceae strongly suggested a relationship with Vitaceae; the presence of this gene in Rafflesiaceae they reasonably thought was caused by horizontal gene transfer from Vitaceae. Barkman et al. (2007) suggested that there had also been a transfer of the mitochondrial <i>atp</i>1 gene from host to parasite. Xi et al. (2012a)  showed that slightly over 2% of the nuclear genome may be involved, some <i>Tetrastigma</i> genes functioning in their new host, and even in a number of vertically transmitted <i>Rafflesia</i> genes, codon usage was <i>Tetrastigma</i>-like, perhaps facilitating the close association of the host and endophytic parasite. Xi et al. (2013a) confirmed this gene movement, which was more extensive than was previously thought; 24-41% of the mitochondrial genes examined had moved from host to parasite, probably by homologous recombination, and again these genes seemed still to be functional.  This is certainly the closest integration of host and parasite genome so far known in  land plants. </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Molina et al. (2014) thought that the entire chloroplast genome in <i>Rafflesia lagascae</i>, at least, had been largely lost (see Bellot &amp; Renner 2015 for discussion). Those gene fragments that could be detected lacked open reading frames, they were not expressed in floral bud tissues, and a third of them had sequence similarities with <i>Tetrastigma</i> genes; any chloroplast remnants might be in the nucleus (see also Krause 2015).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The plant is tanniniferous (Gottlieb et al. 1989). Although there are stomata in <i>Rafflesia</i>, they are clearly abnormal, having three or more guard cells (Cammerloher 1920).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There has been much debate as to what the perianth and the diaphragm/annulus (the latter forming a floral chamber) of the flowers of Rafflesiaceae might represent, although this has largely been cleared up by  Nikolov et al. (2013, 2014a).  <i>Sapria</i> can be interpreted as having a biseriate perianth (the spreading lobes of the flower), the diaphragm in the middle is a corona of sorts (perhaps rather similar to such structures in Passifloraceae) that is derived from the annulus; it arises  where the expression of B and C genes changes (Nikolov et al. 2013: morphological and gene-expression studies). However, in <i>Rafflesia</i> the tubular structure below the diaphragm seems to have an inner and outer portion, suggesting that the spreading lobes represent the outer portion and are the calyx/outer perianth whorl and the diaphragm the inner portion and the connate corolla/inner perianth whorl (also D. Boufford, pers. comm.), while a rim at the base of the tube/around the gynostemium is the annulus. <i>Rhizanthes</i> lacks a diaphragm, but its perienth tube clearly has an inner and outer portion, and a slight bump on the perianth is probably where a fragmented annulus has become adnate to the perianth. Thus Nikolov et al. (2013) showed that the tubular structure found in all three genera develops in different ways - in <i>Rafflesia</i> it is a K/C tube alone and in <i>Sapria</i> and <i>Rhizanthes</i> there is a K/C tube in large part formed by the activities of the annulus (<!--Nikolov &amp; Davies 2017/-->). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The ovary loculi develop by cell separation, unique in flowering plants, and the apex of the floral shoot becomes evident in a similar fashion (Nikolov et al. 2014a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Furness and Rudall (2004) note a very distinctive combination of microsporogenesis and pollen morphology for the family; for pollen morphology, see also Blarer et al. (2004). The outer integument, when present, is one cell
layer thick, but it is not easy to interpret the ovule (see Solms-Laubach 1874; Ernst &amp; Schmid 1913 for more details). Although the funicle is bent, the integument is not adnate to it; in taxa with a single integument, there is a swelling on the chalaza, perhaps an indication of the other integument.</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;">During germination of some <i>Rafflesia</i>, at least, the seed is anchored onto the host by sticky endosperm tubules and also the embryonal primary haustorium, the whole thing looking rather like a T4 bacteriophage (Arekal &amp; Shivamurthy 1976).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Rafflesiales of some authors included a number of other echlorophyllous, parasitic groups such as Cytinaceae (here Malvales), Hydnoraceae (Piperales-Aristolochiaceae), Apodanthaceae (Cucurbitales), and Mitrastemonaceae (Ericales). Many early and more recent authors have sought an affinity between Rafflesiaceae and taxa like Aristolochiacaeae (references in Takhtajan 1997), perhaps in part because of a belief that the pollen of the former had only a single aperture, as did that of Aristolochiaceae; there is a gynostemium of sorts and extrorse anthers in both. Cocucci and Cocucci (1996) saw connections of Rafflesiaceae first with Apodanthaceae and then with Annonaceae.</p>

<ul><li>Euphorbiaceae may be recognised by the leaves on the
one branch often being variable in size and/or shape, the secondary veins are
often &plusmn; palmate, the margins are toothed, and there are sometimes glands of various kinds. Cauline stipules are common, as is latex
(the latter not in Acalyphoideae). The
plants are mono- or dioecious, the flowers are small, the perianth usually
inconspicuous, there are usually three carpels with prominent stigmas, and the
fruits have a distinctive and persistent columella, large and often carunculate
seeds (one per loculus), and explosive dehiscence. Euphorbiaceae are quite often poisonous.</ul>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> A <i>Mallotus</i>/<i>Macaranga</i>-like plant has been found in deposits from New Zealand that are about 23 m.y. old - this clade is not currently known from the island (Lee et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Diversification within Acalyphoideae occurred within the last ca 70 m.y. (Davis et al. 2005a). Some estimates for the divergence of <i>Macaranga</i> and <i>Mallotus</i> are as early as (79.1-)63.8(-63.3) m.y.a., and Van Welzen et al. (2014a) suggested that the two showed general congruence in their dispersal patterns, crown group ages of the two being ca 32.7 and 34.3 m.y. respectively. The stem and crown group ages for the large genus <i>Croton</i> (Crotonoideae) are ca 55 and ca 40 m.y. respectively (van Ee et al. 2008). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Divergence within Euphorbieae may have begun (63.5-)48.9(-40.5) m.y.a. (Bruyns et al. 2011); see below for dates for divergence within the very speciose <i>Euphorbia</i>. There seems to be but a single origin of the distinctive cyathium that is an apomorphy for the genus (Park &amp; Backlund 2002; Wurdack et al. 2005), and although it characterises a very species-rich clade, diversification may also be associated with the evolution of a variety of distinctive life forms, seed dispersal mechanisms, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanisms (see below). For fruit and seed morphology  in subgenus <i>Esula</i>, see Pahlevani et al. (2015), and for the biogeographic implications of relationships in the genus, see e.g. Dorsey et al. (2013) and Riina et al (2013). Subgenus <i>Chamaesyce</i> has undergone notable diversification on Hawaii where trees growing in mesophytic forest have evolved (Y.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> "Euphorbiaceae", i.e. including Phyllanthaceae, Putranjivaceae, etc., are often the second most abundant family in tropical rainforests in South-East Asia and Africa (Gentry 1988); Euphorbiaceae s. str. are common in Amazonian forests and they have a disproportionally high number of the common species with stems at least 10 cm across (ter Steege et al. 2013).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Both growth patterns and carbon fixation pathways show much diversity in <i>Euphorbia</i>. Even <i>Euphorbia</i> s. str. (i.e. not including <i>Chamaesyce</i>, etc.) alone was extremely variable (Keller 1996), but with the inclusion of <i>Chamaesyce</i> and other segregate genera (e.g. Horn et al. 2009a, 2012) there is yet more diversity. Basic relationships within the genus are [<i>Esula</i> [<i>Rhizanthium</i> (= <i>Athymalus</i>) [<i>Euphorbia</i> + <i>Chamaesyce</i>]]] (for subgeneric names, see Bruyns et al. 2011, also below).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Diversification in <i>Euphorbia</i> is estimated to have begun over 42.5 m.y.a. (van Ee et al. 2008: subgenus <i>Esula</i> not included; see also Horn et al. (2012). Other estimates are (47.2-)36.6(-29.0) m.y.a. (Bruyns et al. 2011) and (54.7-)47.8(-41.0) m.y. (Horn et al. 2014, q.v. for more ages). Divergence within the largely succulent subgenera <i>Athymalus</i> and <i>Euphorbia</i> is rather more recent, (38.2-)28.1(-22) and (39.6-)29.9(-22.5) m.y. respectively, with much speciation in the latter subgenus in particular occuring within the last ca 13 m.y. or so (Bruyns et al. 2011). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The evolution of the annual habit and the cactiform growth form are associated with much speciation (Horn et al. 2009a, 2010b). The annual habit, common in <i>Euphorbia</i> subgenera <i>Chamaesyce</i> and <i>Esula</i>, has evolved eight times or more in subgenus <i>Esula</i> alone (Frajman &amp; Sch&ouml;nswetter 2011; Riina et al. 2013; see also Peirson et al. 2014). Stem succulence in <i>Euphorbia</i> - some are quite massive stem succulents (see below: Vegetative Variation) - is associated with the evolution of a monopodial growth form and axillary inflorescences (Horn et al. 2012, 2014; see also Dorsey et al. 2013); these plants are cactus-analogues of drier areas throughout Africa and into India and even beyond (Steinmann &amp; Porter 2002; Bruyns et al. 2006, 2011). Succulent species of <i>Euphorbia</i> are a particularly prominent component of the winter rainfall vegetation of the Succulent Karoo of south west Africa (Nyffeler &amp; Eggli 2010b). Plants of subgenus <i>Euphorbia</i> in Madagascar that are chamaephytes, with tuberiform structures and succulent leaves, grow in the drier, but not particularly warmer, areas, although cactiform species surprisingly showed no particular environmental correlations there (Evans et al. 2014). Xeromorphism of one form or another has evolved ca 14 times in the genus (Horn et al. 2012). All told, some 850 species belonging to all four subgenera are succulents, and succulence has evolved ten times or so, and in subgenera <i>Athymalus</i> and <i>Euphorbia</i> the succulent habit is particularly common, both subgenera lacing annuals (Horn et al. 2010b; Bruyns et al. 2011; Morawetz &amp; Riina 2011; Dorsey et al. 2013; see Eggli 2002 for an enumeration of taxa). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Most of the ca 350 species of subgenus <i>Chamaesyce</i> section <i>Anisophyllum</i> carry out C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. This probably originated a single time here and section <i>Anisophyllum</i> is the largest  C<sub>4</sub> clade in the eudicots (Y. Yang &amp; Berry 2011a; Yang et al. 2012; Horn et al. 2014). Some C<sub>4</sub> species grow in the more arid parts of Africa and are also succulents. Species growing on Hawaii form a distinctive woody radiation and include some of the largest C<sub>4</sub> plants anywhere, some being trees up to 9 m tall that grow in mesic forests (Pearcy &amp; Troughton 1975; Robichaux &amp; Pearcy 1984: see Winter 1981 for slightly larger C<sub>4</sub> Chenopodioideae); Horn et al. (2012) discuss how the tree habit might evolve in a clade in which all branches are basically plagiotropic. This Hawaiian clade appears to have evolved from within a small clade of weedy annuals now found in Southern USA, Mexico, and the Caribbean (see also Yang et al. 2009); hybridisation is involved in their origin, and it is also known from elsewhere in the C<sub>4</sub> clade (Yang &amp; Berry 2011b).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The C<sub>4</sub> clade, predominantly herbaceous,  probably evolved in drier areas of North America, and it is sister to the small subsection <i>Acutae</i> from southwest North America which includes C<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub> herbs, although only species with the two latter kinds of photosynthesis have been sequenced (Y. Yang &amp; Berry 2011a, esp. b; Yang et al. 2012). T. Sage et al. (2011) described C<sub>2</sub> photosynthesis in subsection <i>Acutae</i>, and they noted that <i>E. angusta</i>, with C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis, had some anatomical similarities with C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> taxa. Horn et al. (2012) emphasize that it is not simply the evolution of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway, but also the adoption of a plagiotropic branching habit, etc., that may have made this clade successful, as well as its movement from the Old to the New World (see also Yang &amp; Berry 2011b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Given the prevalence of succulence in <i>Euphorbia</i> and its association with drier habitats, it is not surprising that CAM is also quite common. Horn et al. (2014) looked at diversification in the genus in the context of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration mechanisms, and found that perhaps 7 of the at least 17 independent acquisitions of CAM photosynthesi (five in Africa-Madagascar) and the single acquisition of  C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis showed increased diversification rates. The former changes occurred in the context of drying climates after the Mid-Miocene ca 14 m.y.a. (estimates of the crown ages of the clades are (15.9-)11, 5.6(-2.5) m.y.a.) and ancestors of these CAM clades were more or less woody plants, and in the Old World they had axillary inflorescences (Horn et al. 2014). The origin of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis may have been somewhat earlier, the crown age being (20.2-)15.3(-10.5) m.y.a., and aridity may not have been a driver (Horn et al. 2014), however, estimates of the age of origin of the pathway vary, some being as recent as (13.1-)10.4(-7.3) m.y. (Christin et al. 2011b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">All 28 species of Cuban <i>Leucocroton</i> (= <i>Croton</i> s.l.) are reported to accumulate nickel (Reeves et al. 1996). In some Brazilian species of <i>Croton</i> water  from fog is taken up through  epidermal emergences (including their stellate/lepidote "hairs"); some cells involved are subepidermal. Immediately below the emergences there are very thick-walled but at most slightly lignified sclereids that appear to be part of the whole absorbtive process (Vitarelli et al. 2016).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Flowers of Euphorbiaceae are generally small, and pseudanthia have originated more than once (and also in Peraceae), and in <i>Dalechampia</i> and some species of <i>Euphorbia</i> inflorescence bracts may be very large and brightly coloured.  <i>Euphorbia</i>, with some 2,400+ species, is by far the biggest clade with pseudanthia (= cyathia). Cyathia are surrounded by bract-like structures that vary considerably in shape and colour, and some or all of these also have conspicuous nectaries. Several species of oligolectic pollinators may visit a single species of <i>Euphorbia</i>, overall, there may be hundreds of species of insect visitors (Ehrenfeld 1979). New World species of <i>Euphorbia</i> that used to be segregated as <i>Pedilanthus</i> (= <i>Euphorbia</i> subg. <i>Euphorbia</i> sect. <i>Crepidaria</i>) have distinctive red, spurred, monosymmetric cyathia pollinated by birds, a "key innovation" (Cacho et al. 2010). The jury is out, but there aren't many species in this clade...</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The ca 115 species of <i>Dalechampia</i> (Acalyphoideae) also have remarkable pseudanthia which have evolved independently of those of <i>Euphorbia</i>. Here female megachilid, euglossine and stingless <i>Trigona</i> (meliponine) bees visit the "flowers" for triterpenoid resins that they use to build their nests (resin is a very uncommon reward in flowering plants, see Armbruster 1984, 1993, 1996); a few male euglossines collect fragrances. The resin has secondarily become used for defence in some species of <i>Dalechampia</i>, probably its original fuction, and there is a reversal in the arrangement of the staminate flowers (Armbruster et al. 2009b). In some Madagascan <i>Dalechampia</i> there is buzz pollination (linked to paedomorphy), itself  derived from generalized pollination, in turn derived from resin flowers - and perhaps generalized pollination is derived from buzz pollination, although the former may have but a single origin (c.f. support values: Armbruster et al. 2013a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Pollination by thrips (Thysanoptera) is particularly common in myrmecophytic species of <i>Macaranga</i> (Fiala et al. 2011); 24/29 species may be so pollinated, based on floral morphology, about double the frequency when compared with non-myrmecophytic species of the genus growing in the West Malesian localities that Fiala et al. visited.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Interfloral protogyny is common in Euphorbiaceae, perhaps associated with the fact that female flowers are often borne towards the base of the infloreacence, and so might be expected to open first (see Bertin &amp; Newman 1993).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Seed dispersal is initially usually by the explosion of the capsule, the seeds being hurled quite some distance - in <i>Hura crepitans</i>, the sand-box tree, the seed has an escape velocity of up to 252 kph and it is hurled up to 45 m  (Swaine &amp; Beer 1977). In addition, some seeds have nutritive elaiosomes (e.g. R&ouml;ssler 1943) which facilitate further local dispersal of the seeds, especially by ants. Around 2,300 species in the family, especially in <i>Euphorbia</i>, are likely to be myrmecochorous (Lengyel et al. 2010). Elaiosomes of one sort or another have evolved ca 13 times in <i>Euphorbia</i> (Horn et al. 2012), and include many of the ca 480 species of subgenus <i>Esula</i> (Riina et al. 2013, see also Peirson et al. 2014 for photographs). A number of species of <i>Euphorbia</i> subgenus <i>Chamaesyce</i> section <i>Anisophyllum</i> in particular have a testa that becomes mucilaginous when wetted (Grubert 1974; Jordan &amp; Hayden 1992).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Caterpillars of nymphalid butterflies are quite common on Euphorbiaceae (Ehrlich &amp; Raven 1964), e.g. caterpillars of the ca 340 species of Biblidinae are found on <i>Dalechampia</i> and <i>Tragia</i> (Euphorbioideae: DeVries 1987; Wahlberg et al. 2009; Nylin et al. 2014). Caterpillars of the spectacular Uraniinae moths are found on <i>Endospermum</i>, <i>Omphalea</i> and <i>Suregada</i>, also Euphorbioideae, throughout the tropics (Lees &amp; Smith 1991); the first two are rather closely related, the position of the last is unclear (Wurdack et al. 2005). It would be interesting in this context to clarify both Euphorbiaceae phylogeny and Uraniinae host plant preferences.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In Malesia about 29 species of fast-growing, large-leaved <i>Macaranga</i> are ecological analogues of the New World <i>Cecropia</i> (Urticaceae); for a phylogeny, see B&auml;nfer et al. (2006) and also  Blattner et al. (2001) and Davies et al. (2001: mymecophily perhaps evolved more than once, but support values low). Food bodies (Beccarian bodies) and extra-floral nectaries provide food for ants (<i>Camponotus</i> and especially <i>Crematogaster</i> spp.) that have an obligate association with the plants, living in their stems which are either hollowed out by the ant or become hollow as the stem ages; myrmecophytism seems to have evolved more than once here (Hatada et al. 2001 for references; Feldhaar 2003a, b). A whole complex of adaptations in <i>Macaranga</i> is involved, for instance, whether the stems are waxy, or not (not all ants can run up waxy stems), whether the food bodies on the stipules are exposed or protected, and whether or not there are extrafloral nectaries on the lamina margins, and these are variously correlated (Federle &amp; Rheindt 2005). The age of the association with <i>Crematogaster</i> subg. <i>Decacraema</i> was estimated at less than 7 m.y., and suggested co-speciation of the two partners (Itino et al. 2001b; see de Vienne et el. 2013), although the aging of the association was rather vague; Itino et al. (2001a and references) thought that an association with coccids, which also provide carbohydrates for the ants, represented the original condition for the ant-plant association. On the other hand, Ueda et al. (2008) offered an age of 20-16 m.y. for the ant-plant association (see also Chomicki &amp; Renner 2015), the association with <i>Coccus</i> scale insects being only 9-7 m.y. old. Other organisms are involved in this association. These include bacteria that live off  material in colony rubbish dumps in <i>M. bancana</i>, for example, that are in turn eaten by rhabditid nematodes that are possibly in turn eaten by the ants;  nematodes (?and bacteria) may move from colony to colony with the queen ants (Maschwitz et al. 2016). <i>Arhopala</i> (a lycaenid) caterpillars may be found in the domatia, and they eat ant larvae but are not attacked by the ants, rather, the products of a tentacle-like gland that is extruded by the caterpillar calm the ants (Maschwitz et al. 1984). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> Although latex might <i>a priori</i> seem to protect the plant in some way, a diversity of bacteria and  fungi (mean: 44 and 21 species repectively) were found growing in latex of cultivated <i>Euphorbia</i> (Gunawardana et al. 2015). Perhaps some of these were endophytes, but between-species variation was great (up to seven fold), and what is actually going on in this system is unclear.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Complex maytansinoids, ansamycin antibiotics, that are likely to be synthesized by fungal endophytes or other plant associates, are found in <i>Trewia</i> (Acalyphoideae: Cassady et al. 2004 for references). The fungus <i>Uromyces pisi</i> causes <i>Euphorbia cyparissias</i> to form nectar-producing pseudoflowers that facilitate transmission of the fungus spermatia (Pfunder &amp; Roy 2000).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> Succulence in <i>Euphorbia</i> is of various types. The plants may have variously articulated or simply pencil-like stems, the latter as in some species of subgenus <i>Chamaesyce</i>, or they may be medusoid, with relatively slender but succulent branches radiating from a stout central axis. The plants may also be spiny in various ways. Thus in subgenus <i>Euphorbia</i> there are spine shields, there are also stipular spines, as well as spines in the stipular position that are not actually vascularized, and branched or simple thorns, which may also do duty as inflorescences (see e.g. Park &amp; Jansen 2007; Carter 2002, esp. illustrations; Bruyns 2010). Bruyns et al. (2011) describe in detail the different forms of stem succulence found in the genus, and they note that in a number of species of subgenus <i>Euphorbia</i> the branches become permanently differentiated; orthotropic axes will not develop from plagiotropic branches. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The whole plant body of some species of <i>Euphorbia</i>-<i>Chamaesyce</i>-<i>Anisophyllum</i> can be compared with the inflorescence of other species of the genus. The seedling apex aborts after the production of a single pair of leaves, and several axillary shoots showing complex determinate and unequal branching patterns produce the adult plant (Hayden 1988).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> The diterpenoid-synthesizing genes form a cluster - except in <i>Manihot</i> (King et al. 2014). A genome duplication in that genus has been dated at (42.1-)40.4(-38.7) m.y.o. (Vanneste et al. (2014a).  </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Phorbol esters in the [Crotonoideae + Euphorbioideae] clade in particular are very diverse; for the biosynthesis of these and other diterpenes, see King et al. (2014). Cyanogens
can be derived from nicotinic acid or valine/isoleucine (Seigler 1994). Latex
and cocarcinogens are both apparently restricted to Euphorbioideae and
Crotonoideae; for the composition of <i>Euphorbia</i> latex, see references in Gunawardana et al. (2015). Distinctive fatty acids in the seed oils are quite common in the family (Badami &amp; Patil 1981); for lectins, see Vandenborre et al. (2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The thickness of first-order roots in the family ranges from 1009.6 &mu;m in <i>Endospermum chinense</i> to 72.6 &mu;m in <i>Macaranga sampsonii</i>, spanning the extremes of the measurements made on 96 species from southern China (Kong et al. 2014). There may be a multi-layered G layer in the tension wood in some species  (Ghislain et al. 2016). Laticifers in Euphorbiaceae are discussed by Rudall (1987, 1994a) and Wiedenhoft et al. (2009); see also Vitarelli et al. (2015) and the cautionary comments in Wurdack et al. (2005). Biesboer and Mahlberg (1981) describe the complex morphology of the starch grains found in the latex of <i>Euphorbia</i> and laticifer evolution there. Prismatic crystals in wood parenchyma and/or ray cells are common, but these also occur in Putranjivaceae and Picrodendraceae, which used to be included in Euphorbiaceae s.l. (Hayden 1994). Stipules may be lacking in species of <i>Euphorbia</i> subgenus <i>Esula</i> (Riina et al. 2013), and 1:1 nodes have been reported from the genus (Sehgal &amp; Paliwal 1974: also somewhat improbable 2:2 nodes). <i>Claoxylon</i> has distinctively rough leaves when dry because of the styloids in their tissues (Kabouw et al. 2008). Vitarelli et al. (2015) discuss the considerable variety of foliar secretory structures in <i>Croton</i> and its near relatives. In addition to recording colleters, the paired basal glands on the lamina (the two have some underlying similarities), etc., they suggest relationships between cells in the lamina filled with secretions ("idioblasts") and short secretory trichomes, whose occurrence is mutually exclusive, and in both of which the secretion is some kind of lipid. Extending the survey would be good... Feio et al. (2016) examine the variety  of secretory structures in other species of the genus, i.a. recording colleters from inside the flower.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The cyathium of <i>Euphorbia</i> is best interpreted as a modified cymose inflorescence with a single, terminal, carpellate flower (see the basically similar arrangement in <i>Jatropha</i>, etc.). Details of its development are provided by Prenner and Rudall (2007), and  although they thought that the morphological nature of both the cyathial glands and the petal-like bracts surrounding the cyathium was unclear (see also Hoppe 1985 and Prenner et al. 2008b), the glands, at least, may be modified commissural stipules (Steinmann &amp; Porter 2002) or derived from involucral bracts (Gagliardi et al. 2016), not necessarily different ideas. "Floral" genes may be expressed in the cyathium as a whole (Prenner et al. 2011). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Vascularization of the ?staminodial nectary in <i>Croton</i> and its near relatives varies; a secretory staminodial nectary may be a high-level apomorphy around there (De-Paula et al. 2011), but it can be difficult to understand possible homologies of floral structures in <i>Astraea</i> (= <i>Croton</i> s.l.: c.f. De-Paula et al. 2011). Prenner et al. (2008a) described the development of the distinctive androecium of <i>Ricinus</i> with its branched stamens; these are not cauline as had been suggested. Some Euphorbiaceae are reported to have two vascular traces supplying each ovule (Venkata Rao &amp; Ramalkshmi 1967). Johri and Kapil (1953) noted that the vascular tissue in ovules of <i>Acalypha indica</i> proceeded one third the way up the nucellus. The projecting nucellus in <i>Codiaeum variegatum</i>, at least, seems to result from periclinal divisions of the epidermal layer of the nucellus, the nucellar cap, although in <i>Euphorbia</i> less striking projections seem to be the result of divisions of the underlying nucellar cells (Bor &amp; Kapil 1975 and references). Mennega (1990) suggested that the subdermal initiation of the inner integument separated Euphorbiaceae from other families.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Van Welzen (1994) described <i>Neoscortechinia</i> (Cheilosoideae) as having a thin, red aril, but no aril was mentioned by Tokuoka and Tobe (2003) or Tokuoka (2007).</b>

Gard.</i> 81. 1994 - and 2013), Radcliffe-Smith and Esser (2001: generic descriptions, etc.), Esser (2001), and Eggli (2002: succulent species), while Hegnauer (1966, 1989), Evans and Taylor (1983: phorbol esters), Jury et al.

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> <i>Neoscortechinia</i> and <i>Cheilosa</i> are strongly supported as being sister to the rest of the family (Wurdack et al. 2005; Tokuoka 2007; Xi et al. 2012b), however, M. Sun et al. (2016) found this genus pair alone to be sister to Rafflesiaceae. "There is no support for a monophyletic Crotonoideae s.l. Instead, there are four distinct lineages (Adenoclineae s.l., Gelonieae, and articulated and inaperturate crotonoids)" (Wurdack et al. 2005: p. 1413) sums up the major problem along the spine of the family, indeed, Tokuoka (2007) found that Adenoclineae and Gelonieae, with a thinner outer integument and unvascularized testa and tegmen, formed a paraphyletic grade at the base of the family (minus Chelisioideae), albeit this topology had little support. Crotonoideae were monophyletic, again with little support, Acalyphoideae and Euphorbiacaeae were monophyletic, but with more support (Tokuoka 2007). For further details of relationships, see Sun et al. (2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are number of distinctive features in the Crotonoideae as broadly construed, but there is as yet no strong evidence that the subfamily is monophyletic (see the C<sub>1-5</sub> clades in the tree above, the C<sub>1-2</sub> clades are the same as in Wurdack et al. 2005). Many features in the subfamilial characterization above are synapomorphies either for individual clades or groups within them; for indtance the <i>trn</i>L-F spacer deletion is a feature of part of Crotonoideae s. str.. Crotonoideae s. str., the C<sub>1-2</sub> clades, may expand from this minimalist circumscription as details of phylogenetic relationships are clarified, and for the most part they have petals, distinctive inaperturate pollen with supratectal processes ("crotonoid pollen"), and the tegmen is usually vascularized. The pollen of <i>Suregada</i> (Crotonoideae:  C<sub>1</sub> clade) is pantoporate and it also
lacks columellae.  The large genus <i>Croton</i> is being actively studied by Berry and collaborators (see Berry et al. 2005; van Ee et al. 2008, 2011, 2015; van Ee &amp; Berry 2009; Riina et al. 2009, 2010; Caruzo et al. 2011 for phylogenies, dates, biogeography, and more). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Although Acalyphoideae in the old sense are paraphyletic, the great bulk of the subfamily is included in a strongly-supported clade, Acalyphoideae s. str., and Cervantes et al. (2016) suggest that <i>Erismanthus</i> is sister to all other Acalyphoideae examined. Several tribes are para- or polyphyletic as currently delimited, perhaps most notably Acalypheae, members of which are in six clades in the tree recovered by Cervantes et al. (2016). Wurdack et al. (2005) discuss groupings in the subfamily in some detail. Slik et al. (2001: morphology), Sierra et al. (2006, 2010 and references [the latter with symmetric resampling values and both qualitative and quantitative variation used]), Kulju et al. (2007a, b) and van Welzen et al. (2014a) evaluate the phylogeny of the <i>Macaranga</i>-<i>Mallotus</i> complex ("Acalypheae"); there are three main clades, and in <i>Mallotus</i> s. str. in particular some small, segregate genera are embedded. Cardinal-McTeague and Gillespie (2016) looked at relationships within the monophyletic Plukenetieae (not so much at <i>Dalechampia</i>, for which see Armbruster et al. 2013a, esp. 2009b), where <i>Tragia</i> in particular was found to be very para/polyphyletic; there was not that much correlation between phylogeny and pollen morphology.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Within Euphorbioideae, usually well supported, Stomatocalyceae, which includes <i>Pimelodendron</i> and <i>Nealchornea</i>,  may be sister to the rest of the subfamily (e.g. Wurdack et al. 2005); they often have extrorse anthers and the testa is at least sometimes vascularized. For details of relationships here, see Wurdack et al. (2005) and M. Sun et al. (2016); the laterr obtained relationships {<i>Euphorbia</i> [<i>Hura</i> ...] [[<i>Sctinostemon</i> + <i>Maprounea</i>] ...].</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Much work has been carried out on relationships within <i>Euphorbia</i> over the last few years. For a phylogeny of <i>Euphorbia</i>, see Molero et al. (2002: Macaronesian taxa), Bruyns et al. (2006), Park and Jansen (2007), Zimmermann et al. (2010) and  Wurdack et al. (2011). The last three authors found that subgenus <i>Esula</i> was sister to the other subgenera, although not always with very strong support - relationships are [<i>Esula</i> [<i>Rhizanthium</i> (= <i>Athymalus</i>) [<i>Euphorbia</i> + <i>Chamaesyce</i>]]] (see also the extensive study by Bruyns et al. 2011; Horn et al. 2012). Sampling was initially poor, however, this has steadily improved. Some characters are particularly common/important within the subgenera, although there is very extensive homoplasy. A few of the major characters are [<i>Esula</i> (annuals, cyathium with 4 glands) [<i>Athymalus</i> (cyathium with 5 glands, inflorescences sometimes lateral, plants succulents) [<i>Euphorbia</i> (inflorescences often lateral, plants succulents) + <i>Chamaesyce</i> (annuals, C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, leaves often opposite)]]] (Horn et al. 2012, q.v. for references and many more details). For relationships in the leafy <i>Euphorbia</i> subgenus <i>Esula</i> in particular, with a considerable number of north temperate taxa, see Frajman and Sch&ouml;nswetter (2011) and Riina et al. (2013); the position of <i>E. lathyris</i> is unclear, but it may be sister to the rest of the subgenus. See also the summary in Geltman et al. (2011) and the study or relationships in the New World section <i>Tithymalus</i> by Peirson et al. (2014). For relationships in the Old World subgenus <i>Athymalus</i>, in which the only Malagasy species, <i>E. antso</i>, is sister to the rest, see Morawetz and Riina (2011) and Peirson et al. (2013). For relationships in the mostly New World subgenus <i>Chamaesyce</i>, see Y. Yang and  Berry (2007, 2011) and Yang et al. (2012), and for those in the large subgenus <i>Euphorbia</i>, see Dorsey et al. (2011, 2013).

<i>Pedilanthus</i>, <i>Monadenium</i>, <i>Synadenium</i>, etc., and is well characterized by its cyathium (e.g. Bruyns 2010 and references); Y. Yang et al.

(2013) that of subgenus <i>Euphorbia</i>, and Peirson et al. (2013) of subgenus <i>Athymalus</i>.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Cronquist's Euphorbiales included Simmondsiaceae (Caryophyllales here), Pandaceae (elsewhere in Malpighiales) and Buxaceae (Buxales), whilst Takhtajan's (1997) Euphorbianae included
Pandaceae and Dichapetalaceae (elsewhere in Malpighiales), as well as
Thymelaeaceae (Malvales) and Aextoxicaceae (Berberidopsidales), but these groups clearly have little to recommend them.  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> <i>Lachnostylis</i> (Phyllanthoideae), a small Cape genus, seems to be a relict element there, its stem age being as much as 97 m.y. (Warren &amp; Hawkins 2006), while the distribution of the <i>Baccaurea</i> group (Antidesmatoideae) may initially have been affected by drift events ca 80 m.y.a. (Haegens 2000); these clade ages should be re-examined. Phyllantheae (<i>Flueggea</i>, <i>Glochidion</i>, etc.) are dated to around 51.8 m.y. (van Welzen et al. 2015). For the possible (post-)Miocene E->W dispersal of <i>Bridelia</i> across the Indian ocean, see Li et al. (2009), and for diversification of <i>Breynia</i> s. str., with around 85 species, perhaps linked with pollination mode (<i>Epicephala</i> moths) and limestone habitats, see van Welzen et al. (2015). For possible fossils daing to the Cretaceous, see Shukla et al. (2016).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> 18/37 species (and one hybrid) of Cuban <i>Phyllanthus</i> growing on serpentine soils are reported to accumulate nickel, while in New Caledonia 14/76 species tested are accumulators (there are some 110 species on that island - see Reeves et al. 1996; Brooks 1998). <i>Phyllanthus balgooyi</i>, growing on ultramafic rock in Sabah, Malaysia, has around 16% by weight of nickel in its phloem sap, the second highest concentration known in angiosperms; normally nickel is found in the epidermis when it accumulates (Mesjasz-Przbylowicz et  al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The ectomycorrhizal <i>Uapaca</i> can locally dominate the vegetation in eastern Madagascar, while on the African mainland it is often a component of Detarieae-dominated woodlands and savannas (White 1983). It is an early successional species in the latter habitat, and acts almost a a nurse tree to other ectomycorrhizal species, all having similar mycorrhizal fungi (H&ouml;gberg  &amp; Piearce 1986; see also Ducousso et al. 2008).  <i>Uapaca paludosa</i> is one of the four  common species mentioned growing in the ca 145,500 km<sup>2</sup> of peat in the Cuvette Centrale in the Congo (Dargie et al. 2017).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology.</u> A fascinating pollination mutualism involves the moth <i>Epicephala</i> (Gracillariidae-Omixolinae - see Kawahara et al. 2016) and some 500+ species of <i>Breynia</i> sect. <i>Breynia</i> and <i>Glochidion</i> (Kato et al. 2003; Kawakita &amp; Kato 2004a, b, 2006; Kawakita et al. 2004; Svensson et al. 2010); the plants involved are all part of <i>Phyllanthus</i> s.l. (see below). Flowers in which the moth lays eggs may lose all their seeds to the growing caterpillars, but the moth pollinates more flowers than those on which it oviposits. This mutualism seems to have evolved several times, perhaps some time after the initial divergence of the  clades in which mutualisms are found - 55.2-33.4 m.y.a. (plant) versus 35-20 m.y. (moth) ago - and it has also been lost (Kawakita &amp; Kato 2009; Kawakita 2010). Ages seem to be in a bit of a muddle (or I am), crown-group <i>Glochidion</i> being only (13-)5.6(-1.6) m.y.o. (van Welzen et al. 2015; q.v. for discussion; ?sampling). <i>Phyllanthus</i> s.l. has speciated on the high islands of southeastern Polynesia, probably mostly within the last 5 m.y. (Hembry et al. 2013), and any phylogenetic congruence between moth and plant appears to break down rather comprehensively here (Hembry et al. 2013). There are host shifts followed by speciation of the moth, not straight coevolution=cospeciation, and different species of plants can share the same pollinator, or a single species of plant may be pollinated by more than one species of moth (Hembry 2015). One wonders how plant and pollinator are able to get from island to island in the Pacific together...  Two species of <i>Epicephala</i> pollinated two species of <i>Phyllanthus</i> in southern China, and although the species of <i>Phyllanthus</i> may be sister taxa, the two moths are not (diffuse coevolution: J. Zhang et al. 2012). The system is complex. Male and female flowers may produce different scents, and female flowers may even change their scent after pollination, perhaps to avoid more visits of the moth and the consequent possible loss of all their seeds to caterpillars (Svensson &amp; Okamoto 2015). The pattern of flowering and fruiting in  species like <i>Glochidion  lanceolaria</i> is such that the eggs of the moth do not hatch for several months after they are laid, the caterpillare pupate inside the capsule, and the moths  hatch about three weeks before the capsule finally opens and releases them (Luo et al. 2017). In Taiwan some <i>Epicephala</i> have become gallers on <i>Phyllanthus</i>, the larvae inside the galls perhaps being protected against the unwelcome attentions of a parasitic braconid wasp (Kawakita et al. 2015). See Ranunculaceae, Saxifragaceae, Moraceae, Caryophyllaceae and Asparagaceae-Agavoideae for similar interactions and Hembry and Althoff (2016) for a review of diversification and coevolution in them.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Bacterial/Fungal Associations.</u> The ectomycorrhizal fungi of <i>Uapaca</i>  group with those from Fabaceae (H&ouml;gberg  &amp; Piearce 1986; Tedersoo et al. 2014a), perhaps reflecting the fact that the two may grow in the same communities. ECM and arbuscular mycorrhizae may occur together (Ba et al. 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> Phyllanthoid branching occurs in many, but not all, species of <i>Phyllanthus</i> s.l. (Kathriarachchi et al. 2006). The orthotropic axes have reduced, spirally-arranged leaves and the plagiotropic axes usually have two-ranked, photosynthetic leaves and flowers in the axils of those leaves. The plagiotropic axes are often of more or less limited growth, and those of <i>P. acidus</i>, for example, are short-lived and lack flowers, so being the functional equivalent of compound leaves; the flowers themselves are borne on short branches lacking photosynthetic leaves and which arise from separate axillary buds on the main axes. Some Caribbean species are yet more modified. Thus the plagiotropic lateral branches of <i>P. epiphyllanthus</i> bear 2-ranked cladodes, each in turn bearing flowers and fruits in 2-ranks in the axils of reduced scale-like leaves. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The only record of cocarcinogens is
from one species of <i>Antidesma</i> (Beuteler et al. 1989). Wood
anatomy is variable - but that of <i>Baccaurea</i> and of <i>Aporosa</i> is very similar (Hayden &amp; Brandt 1984; Jangid &amp; Gupta 2017), although the variation has not been integrated with the phylogeny. The nodes are quite often unilacunar (Thakur &amp; Patil 2002).</b>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The inflorescence of <i>Uapaca</i> is a pseudanthium. There has been some discussion over the nature of the perianth, especially in <i>Phyllanthus</i>. <i>Phyllanthus urinaria</i>, for example, has 3-merous flowers, the flowers having six perianth parts and, in staminate flowers, three connate stamens. The  six perianth parts are in two whorls and each part has but a single vascular trace, although members of the inner whort also have traces purely of phloem which supply the nectaries. Because they have these phloem traces and because the perianth members are in two whorls, Gama et al. (2016) suggest that <i>P. urinaria</i> has sepals and petals, and their aestivation is open. The pollen is very variable in <i>Phyllanthus</i> in
particular (Webster 1956). The outer integument is
variable in thickness.  The fruit type of the ancestor of Phyllanthaceae is unclear (Kathriarachchi et al. 2005). The exotegmen is most often described as being ribbon-like or tracheoidal.  However, Hymenocardieae (<i>Didymocistus</i>, <i>Hymenocardium</i>) have a collapsed tracheoidal exotegmen and large tanniniferous endotegmic cells; do they belong here (Tokuoka &amp; Tobe 2001)? - yes, say Wurdack et al. (2004) and Kathriarachchi et al. (2005).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Wurdack et al. (2004: also morphology), Samuel et al. (2005: two gene analysis) and Sun et al. (2016) discuss general phylogenetic relationships. Kathriarachchi et al. (2005: five-genes; see also Hoffmann et al. 2006; Xi et al. 2012b) divide the family into two main clades, one largely with fasciculate inflorescences (it includes <i>Lingelsheimia</i>, sometimes previously associated with Putranjivaceae, and <i>Dicoelia</i>, ditto with Pandaceae), see Phyllanthoideae above, and the other (including Hymenocardieae) tanniniferous, see Antidesmatoideae above (see also Xi et al. 2014b). <i>Croizatia</i> has previously been associated with genera included in Picrodendraceae, although it differs in several morphological features; it is here placed in Phyllanthaceae (see Wurdack et al. 2004; Wurdack 2008)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For the phylogeny of the <i>Phyllanthus</i> area, see Kathriarachchi et al. (2006), Lorence and Wagner (2011), Pruesapan et al. (2008, 2012) and Z.-D. Chen et al. (2016); <i>Phyllanthus</i> is paraphyletic. Voronstova et al. (2007) discuss relationships in Poranthereae. <i>Cleistanthus</i> is polyphyletic (Li et al. 2009).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> Govaerts et al. (2000: as Euphorbiaceae) provide a checklist and bibliography, but this is now dated - e.g. see Vorontsova and Hoffmann (2008) for genera in Phyllanthoideae-Poranthereae, while Hoffmann et al. (2006, q.v. for more details) provide the phylogenetic classification followed here.</p>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> The limits of <i>Cleistanthus</i> will have to be adjusted, and most species will need a new name (Li et al. 2009), while despite <i>Phyllanthus</i>
already being large, I would broaden it to include <i>Glochidion</i> (some 300 species), <i>Breynia</i>, <i>Sauropus</i> (70 spp.), etc. (Kathriarachchi et al. 2006; Lorence &amp; Wagner 2011;  c.f. Pruesapan et al. 2008, 2012; van Welzen et al. 2014b). However, phylogenetic relationships are still not well enough understood to make the needed changes. </p>

<p>9/27. Africa, America, S. India and Sri Lanka; tropical and warm temperate.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> The New World <i>Piranhea</i> may dominate flooded forests (Connell &amp; Lowman 1989). Soils of communities dominated by <i>P. mexicanum</i>, with arbuscular mycorrhizae, were very like adjacent soils supporting mixed forests, germination of <i>Piranhea</i> seeds on soils of the two types was indistinguishable, etc. (Martijena 1998: as <i>Celaenodendron</i>).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Seed Dispersal.</u> Myrmecochory occurs in the majority of the species of the family (Lengyel et al. 2009, 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Vegetative Variation.</u> Leaves are very variable here. Genera like <i>Oldfieldia</i> have opposite, palmately-compound leaves, and in <i>Podocalyx</i>, although the  leaves are simple, the petioles are swollen at both ends.  Lamina margins are usually entire, but there are minute glands on the margins of <i>Austobuxus</i> while the margins of are strongly serrate. A number of taxa have very small leaves ca 1 cm long or less, and these are sessile and trifoliolate in <i>Micranthemum</i>. Stipules are often minute, but in <i>Androstachys</i> they are large, intrapetiolar and enclose the bud.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> <i>Podocalyx</i> probably has trilacunar nodes (e.g. leaf scars on <i>Arac&aacute; Inventory TF-2-20</i>).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Picrodendron</i> may have a perianth of two whorls (Hakki 1985), or perhaps it is modified quincuncial.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Additional information is taken from  Radcliffe-Smith and Esser (2001: genera, etc.), Wurdack et al. (2004), van Welzen &amp; Forster (2010), and Webster (2013), all general, Westra and Koek-Noorman (2004) and Hayden
(1977, 1994), all wood anatomy, Levin and Simpson (1994: pollen), Huber (1991) and Tokuoka and Tobe (1999: seed anatomy),  and Merino Sutter et al. (2006: morphology of carpellate flowers).  </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The family is poorly known.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> See Wurdack et al. (2004) and Xi et al. (2012b) for the phylogeny reflected in the classification above; the relationships are well supported.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Stuppy (1996) noted that both <i>Picrodendron</i> and <i>Oldfieldia</i> were
rather different from other taxa included in his Oldfieldioideae, and he
compared the latter with Meliaceae because of similarity in seed characters. However, both genera are firmly in Picrodendraceae-Picrodendreae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Two other genera have been associated with this group in the past. <i>Paradrypetes</i> is probably to be
included in Rhizophoraceae, although it is like <i>Podocalyx</i> in particular in wood anatomy and pollen morphology (Levin 1992). <i>Croizatia</i> (see Levin 1992) is also odd, with 5 petals,
an extrastaminal nectary and style with distinct branches, and it lacks the distinctive pollen of the family; it is here placed in Phyllanthaceae (not monophyletic in Sun et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b>  For genera, see Euphorbiaceae-Oldfieldioideae (Webster 1994b). Govaerts et al. (2000) provides a checklist and bibliography (as Euphorbiaceae).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b>  Picrodendraceae are the old Euphorbiaceae-Oldfieldioideae (see Webster 1994b). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> McDill and Simspon (2011) suggested that crown-group Hugonioideae are Oligocene-Miocene in age, although Schneider et al. (2016) suggested a late Miocene age of a mere (13.5-)7.6(-2.9) m. years.</p>

<p>Synonymy: <b>Hugoniaceae</b> Arnott</p>

<ul><li>The leaf may have longitudinal lines on the abaxial surface, the caducous petals are contorted and often
yellow, and the fruits are often septicidal and have only a few seeds. I find Linaceae difficult to
recognize...</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> <u>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</u> <i>Hesperolinon</i> (= <i>Linum</i> s.l.) is notably diverse on the serpentine soils of the western United States (Schneider et al. 2016).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology and Seed Dispersal.</u> Heterostylous flowers are scattered in Linoideae, and tristyly is reported from at least some Hugonioideae (Meeuse et al. 2011), but whether heterostyly is an apomorphy for Linaceae is unclear; breeding systems have certainly been labile (Thompson et al. 1996; McDill et al. 2008, 2009). In <i>Linum suffruticosum</i>, at least, heterostyly  involves positioning of anthers and stigmas so that pollen is placed on the  insect in quite different places (dorsally, ventrally) by the anthers of the flowers of the different morphs (Armbruster et al. 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A number of Linoideae have myxospermous seeds (references in Western 2012).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Economic Importance.</b> Seeds of flax (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i>) have been used for oil, etc., for about 10,000 years (Vaisey-Genser &amp; Morris 2003); linen is made from stem fibres.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Ellagic acid is not reported from
Linoideae, but members of this subfamily are largely herbaceous. Flat vernation is reported from <i>Linum narbonense</i> by Cullen (1978),
other taxa may be conduplicate. Bracts and bracteoles have a single vascular trace ().</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Tirpitzia bilocularis</i> has a corolla tube over 2 cm long. The "staminodes" may lack any vascularization (Al-Nowaihi &amp; Khalifa 1973). Tobe and Raven (2011) suggest that the inner integument is multiplicative. In Hugonioideae, only half of the ovules may develop and produce seeds. Guignard (1893) drew the ovules of <i>Linum</i> as having a single parietal layer of cells; at the base of the embryo sac there was a persistent narrow column of cells, while Boesewinkel (1980a) also suggested there might on occasion be a single layer of parietal cells and a nucellar cap two cells accross.  Note that septicidal dehiscence, presumably liberating pyrenes, may occur in Linoideae (Spichiger et al. 2002).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For general information on the family and
its possible segregates see Robertson (1971: Linoideae), van Hooren and
Nooteboom (1984, 1988a), Jardim (1999: New World Hugonioideae) and Dressler et al. (2013); see also Hegnauer (1966, 1989: chemistry), Schmidt et al. (2010: lignans, in most <i>Linum</i> alone), van Welzen and Baas (1984) and Kumar (1977), both anatomy, Cremers (1974: growth in <i>Hugonia</i>), L. L. Narayana (1964, 1970) and Narayana and Rao (1966, 1969, 1978a), all embryology, floral anatomy, etc., and Schewe et al. (2011: floral development in <i>Linum</i>.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> McDill et al. (2009: focus on Linoideae) oulined phylogenetic relationships in the family; Linoideae may be monophyletic, but support is from posterior probabilities only; the status of Hugonioideae is unclear. However, in the more extended sudy of McDill and Simpson (2011) Linoideae are well supported, although <i>Linum</i> is paraphyletic and its current sectional limits need adjusting, Hugonioideae are monophyletic, but still lacking strong support. Schneider et al. (2016) recovered both subfamilies with good support, but c.f. Sun et al. (2016). Within Hugonioideae, <i>Hugonia</i> was paraphyletic and included <i>Philbornea</i> and <i>Indorouchera</i>; the Australian <i>H. jenkinsii</i> was sister to the combined clade (Schneider et al. 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> The topology suggested by McDill and Simpson (2011) and  Schneider et al. (2016) necessitate nomenclatural adjustments. It is best to expand <i>Linum</i>; certainly, <i>Cliococca</i> must go, and if there is a desire to maintain <i>Hesperolinon</i> (it does have a sectional name in <i>Linum</i>), then another four or five genera will be needed. Generic limits around <i>Hugonia</i> are also difficult.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous relationships.</b> For an early detailed discussion on relationships of Linaceae, then thought to be a "central" family, see Hallier (1923). Linaceae have been linked with Erythroxylaceae (the two have even been included in the same family) and Humiriaceae, and thence to Geraniales (e.g. Narayana &amp; Rao 1978b), or the three families together are placed in Linales (Cronquist 1981); see also Boesewinkel and Geenen (1980)</p>
