<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution.</b> Possible apomorphies for flowering plants are in bold. The actual level at which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is because some taxa basal to the [magnoliid + monocot + eudicot] group have been surprisingly little studied, there is considerable homoplasy as well as variation within and between families of the ANITA grade in particular for several of these characters, and also because details of relationships among gymnosperms will affect the level at which some of these characters are pegged. For example, if reticulate-perforate pollen is optimized to the next node on the tree (see Friis et al. 2009b for a discussion), it effectively makes the pollen morphology of the common ancestor of all angiosperms ambiguous... Ther are other features such as a nucellus only one (Nymphaeales) to three cells thick above the embryo sac and a stylar canal lacking an epidermal layer that appear to be plesiomorphous for basal grade angiosperms (Williams 2009), however, where on the tree a thicker nucellus and a stylar epidermal layer are acquired has not been indicated. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2001) estimated that this node was (179-)171, 153(-145) m.y. old, in line with other early estimates (Magall&oacute;n 2009); Soltis et al. (2008: a variety of estimates) give an age of  180-132 m.y. ago.  Magall&oacute;n and Castillo (2009) offer an age of ca 229 m.y. for relaxed and 127 m.y. for constrained penalized likelihood datings, while Moore et al. (2010: 95% HPD) suggest an age of  (162-)155(-145) m.y.,  Clarke et al. (2011: 95% credibility intervals) ages of (231-)197(-169) m.y., towards the upper end of the suggestions then, N. Zhang et al. (2012; see also Xue et al. 2012) ages of (211-)179(-158) m.y., and Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013) an age of around 183.4 m.y. ago. Ages around ca 139 m.y.a. (Magall&oacute;n et al. 2015) and 184.5-173 m.y.a. are suggested in Naumann et al. (2013) and, the other extreme, (266, 233-)227, 195(-173) m.y. by Zeng et al. (2014) and ca 255 m.y.a. by Z. Wu et al. (2014). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">A fossil-based estimate for the age of this node is ca 113 m.y. (Crepet et al. 2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For discussion as to where characters of pollen morphology and development are to be placed on the tree, see Taylor and Osborn (2006) and also  Friis et al. (2009b); it partly depends on how the characters are defined and partly on the recent discovery of fossil Nymphaeales that do not have the pollen characteristics of extant members of the clade. For vessel evolution in angiosperms, including that in  Nymphaeales, see the <a href="amborellalesweb2.htm#VascEvol" target="home">Amorellales</a> page.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Cabombaceae and Nymphaeaceae do have vessels of a sort (Carlquist &amp; Schneider 2009; Schneider &amp; Carlquist 2009).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">For cell lineages in the embryo sac see Huang and Russel (1992) and Friedman (2006); identification of the pattern described above apparently goes back to Porsch (1907), although it has been observed for relatively few plants. For embryo sac evolution, see Friedman and Ryerson (2009). For the possibility of a genome duplication at about this position, see Cui et al. (2006) and dePamphilis et al. (2009).</p>

(Iles et al. 2014), as little as (176.6-)97.7(-42.8) m.y.a. (Zhou et al. 2014), or as much as ca 164 (Z. Wu et al. 2014), ca 188 m.y. (Tank et al. 2015) or ca 209 m.y. (Foster et al. 2016a: q.v. for details).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The curious fossil <i>Archaefructus</i>, probably an aquatic plant and about 124 m.y. old, has been linked with Hydatellaceae in morphological analyses (Doyle &amp; Endress 2007, 2010; Doyle 2008b). Although they have very little in common in terms of overall appearance, <i>Archaefructus</i> may be another early aquatic angiosperm with very unconventional floral morphology. Hydatellaceae may be represented in the pollen record from the Isle of Wight in rocks of some 130 m.y. of age (Hoffmann &amp; Zetter 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Numerous other fossils have been identified as members of Nymphaeales; these are discussed below under Cabombaceae and Nymphaeaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Note:</b>  <b>Boldface</b> denotes possible apomorphies, (....) denotes a feature common in the clade, exact status uncertain, [....] includes explanatory material. Note that the particular node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned
is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see <a href="introductionnew.htm#Warning" target="home">above</a>).</p>	

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> Cretaceous fossils assignable to Nymphaeaceae are quite common, and it has been suggested that Nymphaeales were "the first globally diverse clade" (Borsch &quot; Soltis 2008: p. 1051; see also Sender et al. 2010). However, looking only at extant taxa, their diversity is slight.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Nymphaeales are a highly derived aquatic clade, so it is unclear to what extent <i>Cabomba</i> or any other member of the order can serve as a model for understanding early angiosperm evolution (c.f. Vialette-Guiraud et al. 2011).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Saarela et al. (2007) suggest a few additional possible synapomorphies for Nymphaeales, and Zeng et al. (2014) thought that having protoxylem lacunae and vascular bundles lacking associated sclerenchyma might be apomorphies. For the development of root hairs, see e.g. Clowes (2000) and Sokoloff et al. (2008a), Borsch et al. (2007) discuss the evolution of a number of floral characters within the order,  M. L. Taylor et al. (2015) outline palynological variation in the context of the phylogeny of the order, and Endress and Doyle (2015: floral morphology) also suggest apomorphies. Understanding where some of these should be placed on the tree is complicated by the highly autapomorphic nature of <i>Hydatella</i> and some lingering uncertainty over the position of Nymphaeales.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> Hydrolysable tannins in this group (e.g. in <i>Nuphar</i>) are different to those found
elsewhere (Gottlieb et al. 1993; Ishimatsu et al. 1989) - although of course Hydatellaceae are here, as in many other features, very poorly known. Although there are minute perforations in the end walls of the cells that make up the water conducting tissues in some Nymphaeaceae, they hardly have the morphology of what are called vessel elements elsewhere, however, there are vessels of a variety of types in the
roots in the stems of <i>Brasenia</i>.  Hydatellaceae also have vessel elements with scalariform perforation plates, although these are absent from the leaves. The distinctive uniseriate trichomes found in all groups may secrete nectar or mucilage, or they may be involved in ion exchange (Vogel 1998a); Wilkinson (2006) calls the trichomes on the leaves, hydropotes. It is possible that there are epidermal oil cells in Nymphaeaceae (Wilkinson 2006); do they contain ethereal oils? </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The inner bracts found in some Hydatellaceae and the inner petals of <i>Cabomba</i> are notably slow in developing (Rudall et al. 2007). If the corolla represents sterilised stamens, as some think, having external staminodes will probably be another synapomorphy at least for [Nymphaeaceae + Cabombaceae]. For discussion about the presence of a  granular infratectum in Nymphaeales, see M. L. Taylor et al. (2013, 2015, also 2014 for other characters); the infractectum is generally columellate, how obviously so depending on the thickness of the infratectal space. Some genera in all families have exotestal cells that are neither very tall nor much thickened (Hamann et al. 1979; Collinson 1980). For the distinctive single-celled chalazal endosperm haustorium, see Rudall et al. (2009b). In general, the endosperm is slight and it probably functions as transfer tissue betweem embryo and perisperm (Friedman et al. 2012).</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b> Hydatellaceae are sister to Xyridaceae in Stevenson et al. (2000; see also Stevenson &amp; Loconte 1995); both have latrorse anthers and an operculum "stopper" that is tegmic in origin. <i>Trithuria</i> and <i>Xyris</i> appear as sister taxa (weak support) and in turn sister to <i>Mayaca</i> (still weaker support), although other Xyridaceae are not immediately related (Michelangeli et al. 2003). However, although Bremer (2002) noted that Mayacaceae and Hydatellaceae might be weakly associated with Xyridaceae or Eriocaulaceae, depending on what taxa were included in the analysis, there were a number of long branches in this area and he excluded the first two families from his final analysis, while Janssen and Bremer (2004) suggested that the association of Hydatellaceae with Mayacaceae was probably an artefact (see also Chase et al. 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">More recent studies (Saarela et al. 2006, esp. 2007, several genes from two compartments, morphology: Friis &amp; Crane 2007 [commentary]) place Hydatellaceae firmly with Nymphaeales, and sister to [Cabombaceae + Nymphaeaceae]; the sequence that placed Hydatellaceae in Poales was a chimaeric pcr recombinant involving a grass and a moss. Many of the morphological features of Hydatellaceae that made it so different from other monocots are consistent with this new position. Hamann (1998) had even noted that the antipodal cells were absent or degenerated early, and absence of these cells would almost be expected if Hydatellaceae were placed here, indeed, Friedman (2008a) and Rudall et al. (2008) found that Hydatellaceae had the distinctive 4-celled embryo sac of other Nymphaeales and Austrobaileyales.</p>

Zealand and Australia (map: from Cooke 1987; FloraBase 2004).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> It has been estimated that crown-group Hydatellaceae are (23.4-)19.1, 17.6(-14.7) m.y.o. (Iles et al. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The pollen <i>Monosulcites riparius</i> in ca 75-70 m.y.o. rocks from Eastern Siberia has been identified as <i>Trithuria</i>, but this is a misidentification if the ages above hold.</p>

<ul><li>Hydatellaceae are rather small more or less caespitose and
often annual aquatic (submerged or not) herbs with linear leaves that have only a single vein, and capitate and usually scapose inflorescences bearing
minute and very reduced flowers; the beaded, penicillate stigmas are
distinctive.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> For the evolution and biogeography of the family - crown Triuridaceae are certainly not Gondwanan in age - see Iles et al. (2014); <i>Trithruria konkanensis</i> (India) and <i>T. lanterna</i> (N. Australia) diverged (1.3-)0.76(-0.24) m.y. ago!</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> <u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> For reproductive ecology - wind-, self-, or hyphohydrous pollination - see M. L. Taylor et al. (2010); the pollen tubes grow down the multicellular hairs under the cuticle (Prychid et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The sieve tube plastids were reported as having triangular proteinaceous inclusions, but these inclusions appear to be of the starchy type as are more to be expected in this part of the tree (Tratt et al. 2009). There is some variation in the epidermis of the root and whether or not root hairs are produced (Sokoloff et al. 2008a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The inflorescence is described as being cymose and capitate, although bractless and with highly reduced flowers, i.e., it is a sort of pseudanthium, although alternative interpretations are possible (Rudall et al. 2007a, 2009a). Early work suggested that the carpels might be initiated outside the stamens, and this has been confirmed (Rudall et al. 2007a); staminate flowers are the first to be initiated in the cymose inflorescence (see also Begoniaceae). Hairs with possible apical secretory cells are known only from the inflorescences. The pedicels seem at least sometimes to be articulated. The fruit opens along three lines as the three vascular bundles separate from the rest of the pericarp (see also Sokoloff et al. 2013a). Both integuments have two cell layers; the operculum is formed from enlarged cells of the inner integument. Starch deposition in tissues that will become perisperm begins before fertilization (Friedman 2008a).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There is some disagreement over the interpretation of the morphology of the embryo. Tillich et al. (2007) compared it with that of a monocot, describing collar rhizoids, a coleoptile, two cotyledonary sheath lobes, and a haustorium. Sokoloff et al. (2008a) suggested that the sheathing structure with its bilobed apex that is found in some species could be interpreted as two more or less completely connate cotyledons. The rest of the embryo is attached to the sheathing structure, and a layer of endosperm is the intermediary between it and the perisperm (Friedman et al. 2012). In some taxa there is apparently no sheathing structure at all, only a haustorial lateral outgrowth (cotyledonary) that goes into the rest of the seed, the rest of the cotyledon being photosynthetic, so the seedlings are simultaneously both phanero- and cryptocotylar - c.f. some monocots (Sokoloff et al. 2013b)! Sokoloff et al. (2008a, 2014) suggested that Hydatellaceae showed how monocot-like embryos/seedlings might have originated. Both Tillich et al. (2007) and Sokoloff et al. (2008a) examined largely surface morphology, neither looked in any detail at anatomy (c.f. Friedman et al. 2012: superb micrographs; Sokoloff et al. 2014). Tuckett et al. (2010: discussion of "ancestral" embryo type for angiosperms must include Amborellaceae, at least; see also Sokoloff et al. 2014) found that the differentiation of the embryo and appearance of the shoot and root occurred only after germination.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Meiosis during microsporogenesis has a number of odd features, and it is possible that (some of) the chromosomes are holocentric (Kynast et el. 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Additional information is taken from Hamann (1998: general), Sokoloff et al. (2008b: family monograph), Cutler (1969: vegetative anatomy), Rudall et al. (2007a: flower/inflorescence development), Remizowa et al. (2008b: pollen), Hamann
(1975) and Rudall et al. (2008a, both embryology, Cook (1983: germination), Hamann et al. (1979: seed anatomy), and Sokoloff et al. (2009a: growth patterns of the perennial species). </p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Previous Relationships.</b> Hydatellaceae had long been considered to be monocots, largely because of their superficial similarity to Centrolepidaceae. Both groups are very reduced morphologically, and indeed Hydatellaceae have been misidentified as Centrolepidaceae. It was unclear if the gynoecium of Hydatellaceae was 1- or 3-carpellate, and since the fruits of <i>Trithuria</i> (= <i>Hydatella</i>) opened by three valves, they looked rather monocot-like. The combination of characters in Hydatellaceae was recognised as being unique to that group, and it made them very distinctive within monocots as a whole (e.g. Hamann et al. 1979; Dahlgren et al. 1985). </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> There has been much discussion over the timing of diversification within the Cabombaceae-Nymphaeaceae clade (e.g. Nixon 2008), and dates from molecular and molecular analyses in part conflict strongly. Wikstr&ouml;m et al. (2001: c.f. relationships) suggested that divergence of the two families occurred (152-)144, 111(-103) m.y.a., while the age in Magall&oacute;n and Castillo (2009) is ca 112 m.y. (see also Tank et al. 2015: ca 112.5 m.y., that in Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013)  around 122.7 m.y., and that in Iles et al. (2014: [Amborellaceae + Nymphaeales]) (107.1-)102.1(-98.8) m.y. ago. However, L&ouml;hne et al. (2008) thought that divergence was only Palaeocene in age, (75-)56.4(-38) m.y.a., while Bell et al. (2010) offered a still younger date of (56-)42, 38(-25) m.y.; Yoo et al. (2005) pegged the crown group age to 44.6 &plusmn; 7.9 m.y. and Naumann et al. (2013), at around 94.75 m.y., suggested an intermediate age.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Early fossil-based estimates for the age of this group were only ca 90 m.y. (Crepet et al. 2004), but substantially earlier dates are likely (Friis et al. 2009b). There are fossils of stem-group Nymphaeaceae, Cabombaceae and/or [Nymphaeaceae + Cabombaceae] from the Lower Cretaceous and from several parts of the world (e.g. D. W. Taylor et al. 2001, 2008; Friis et al. 2011). Although other fossils possibly of this group (to a certain extent characters of the two families are combined) are known from the Barremian-Aptian deposits 125-113 m.y.o. in Portugal (Friis et al. 2001), they may also be from a member of Austrobaileyales (Gandolfo et al. 2004); see also von Balthazar et al. (2008) for another fossil perhaps assignable to this general [Nymphaeales-Austrobaileyales] area.  D. W. Taylor et al. (2008, see also Taylor 2008) noted how inclusion of different fossils affected ideas of relationships.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><i>Pluricarpellatia</i>, probably to be placed in or near Cabombaceae (Doyle &amp; Endress 2014), is known since the Early Crtetaceous (Mohr et al. 2008). The Early Cretaceous <i>Monetianthus</i> was embedded within crown Nymphaeaceae in morphological analyses (Friis et al. 2009b, but c.f. 2011; see also Doyle &amp; Upchurch 2014; Doyle 2016), and this may be true for  the mid-Albian <i>Carpestella</i>, from Virginia (Doyle &amp; Endress 2014); both these genera have very small flowers. The distinctive reticulate-perforate pollen of <i>Monetianthus</i> would then be independently derived within Nymphaeales, but other analyses also placed the genus at the node above Nymphaeales along the spine of the angiosperm tree (Friis et al. 2009b). Yoo et al. (2005) thought that the fossil <i>Microvictoria</i> was perhaps stem group Nymphaeales (c.f. Gandolfo et al. 2004; Endress 2006; Friis et al. 2011).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> D. W. Taylor et al. (2008, see also Taylor 2008) discuss the vegetative evolution of the group (see some of the characters above); the inclusion of different fossils affected relationships, and hence evolutionary interpretations, in analyses of morphological variation. Friis et al. (2011: fig.  20.2) discussed diversification in this clade in some detail, assigning many Palaeogene fossils to the two families; see also D. W. Taylor et al. (2001) for fossils of Cabombaceae.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Generalist pollination is common in this clade (Gotttsberger 2016).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Ecology &amp; Physiology.</b> Nymphaeales, along with other angiosperms, may have dominated aquatic habitats in Europe by the  Albian ca 105 m.y.a. (Sender et al. 2010).</p>  

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> For micromorphological details of vessels and tracheids, see Carlquist and Schneider (2009) and Schneider et al. (2009); details of the wall structure of tracheids, at least, are very distinctive. Note that Carpenter (2005) described stomata as being largely variants of the actino/stephanocytic types; only one member of Cabombaceae was studied. D. W. Taylor (2008) outlined the vegetative morphology of this clade. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Warner et al. (2008, 2009) discuss perianth evolution, and in Warner et al. (2008) there is a useful summary on the literature on perianth morphology. Zini et al. (2016) described the distinctive nucellar epidermis of the ovules as being an epistase.</p>

M. L. Taylor and Williams (2009) describe details of reproduction of <i>Cabomba</i> from pollination to fertilization, while Schneider and Jeter (1982) discuss its pollination. For more details, see Erbar (2014) and Gottsberger (2016)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The root endodermis has a Casparian strip and suberin lamellae. It is unclear how to interpret nodal anatomy. In <i>Cambomba</i> a trace leaves from each member of a vascular budle pair which shortly thereafter fuse commissurally, creating a nodal plexus; the foliar traces fuse and then divide, providing two petiolar bundles (Moseley et al. 1984). <i>Brasenia</i> has stems that are encased in a thick layer of mucilage; there are paired, glandular patches at the nodes. The peltate leaves are spirally arranged, although in some taxa they are uncommon; the more or less dichotomously-divided submerged leaves are opposite. There are five vascular bundles in the sepals and three vascular bundles in the petals of <i>Cambomba</i>, in both cases there is a single trace leaving the floral axis (Moseley et al. 1984). Stamens are sometimes physically close to each nectary and then they appear paired (&Oslash;rgaard et al. 1992). Pollen of <i>Cabomba</i> has striate exine. Although the endexine of mature pollen of <i>Brasenia schreberi</i> is not lamellate, it is laid down in plates (M. L. Taylor &amp; Osborn 2006).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The granular infratectum of Podostemaceae has been compared with that of Cabombaceae; both are aquatics (Passarelli et al. 2002).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some information is taken from Williamson and

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Age.</b> E. L. Schneider et al. (2004) suggested an age for the family of ca 121 m.y.a., Magall&oacute;n et al. (2013) an age of around 100.1  m.y., while Iles et al. (2014) suggested an age of (99.6-)95.5(-92.9) m.y. ago. However, estimates in Bell et al. (2010)  are only (49-)32, 29(-15) m.y. and those in Zhou et al. (2014) (60.6-)28.2(-3.8) m.y., while those in Naumann et al. (2013) are around 51.8 or 40.8 m.y., somewhat intermediate.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The Late Aptian/Early Albian Cretaceous <i>Monetianthus</i>, from Portugal, is embedded in Nymphaeaceae in morphological analyses (Friis et al. 2009b). <i>Microvictoria</i>, a somewhat later fossil from the Turonian ca 90 m.y. old and found in New Jersey, U.S.A., is very like <i>Victoria</i> (= <i>Nymphaea</i>). <i>Victoria</i> has "paracarpels" immediately surrounding the gynoecium, and these are also found in <i>Microvictoria</i>; indeed, flowers of this latter are like those of <i>Victoria</i> in almost all respects, although they are less than 1/10th their size (Gandolfo et al. 2004). <i>Jaguariba</i> is assignable to crown group Nymphaeaceae; it is from the Aptian Crato flora of northeast Brazil and is some 115 m.y.o. (Coiffard et al. 2013a). For <i>Cecilanthus</i>, from early Cenomanian Maryland ca 100 m.y.a., see Herendeen et al.

<ul><li>Nymphaeaceae are the quintessential waterlilies, with
large flowers, usually many free perianth parts and stamens, and many ovules in
each carpel, the placentation usually being clearly laminar. Many species have no stem, the plants essentially being aquatic rosette plants.</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Evolution:</b> <u>Divergence &amp; Distribution.</u> The family is thought to have been much more diverse in earlier epochs, and distinctive seeds with a micropylar and palisade exotesta with sinuous anticlinal walls that can be assigned here being common in the Cretaceous (Friis et al. 2009b, 2011 for references).  Recently, fossils assigned to crown group Nymphaeaceae (as <i>Jaguariba</i>) have been found in the Aptian Crato flora, some 115 m.y.o. in northeast Brazil (Coiffard et al. 2013a). However, although the family is widespread and probably very old, individual clades within it are relatively localized, and it has even been suggested that crown group diversification may have occurred in the northern hemisphere as late as the early Caenozoic (L&ouml;hne et al. 2008; see also Friis et al. 2011).</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Pollination Biology &amp; Seed Dispersal.</u> Thermogenesis has been detected in the flowers of some Nymphaeaceae (Seymour 2001; Seymour &amp; Matthews 2006). Beetles and a variety of other insects, including flies, are pollinators (e.g. Gandolfo et al. 2004; Padgett 2007; Thien et al. 2009). Scarab beetles (Cyclocephalini) may have pollinated night-flowering water lilies for some 100 m.y.; they pollinate species both in America, where the beetles are common, and in Africa, where the beetles are otherwise very uncommon (Ervik &amp; Knudsen 2003). Beetle pollination may have occurred even in the early small-flowered members of the fammily (M. L. Taylor et al. 2013 and references). The distinctive flowers of <i>Ondinea</i> (= <i>Nymphaea ondinea</i>), wind pollinated, are derived from <i>Nymphaea</i>-type flowers (L&ouml;hne et al. 2009). Schneider (1979) summarized information about the pollination biology of the family; see also Erbar (2014), and for much detail, see Gottsberger (2016: Table 2).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">The progamic phase, the time between pollination and fertilization, is notably short, up to a mere 8 hours, as in at least some other aquatic angiosperms (including <i>Nelumbo</i>:  see Williams et al. 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Dehiscence of the fruit of Nymphaeaoideae is by swelling of the mucilage inside it, whereupon the wall splits irregularly.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Plant-Animal Interactions.</u> Nymphaeaceae are host plants of reed beetles, Chrysomelidae-Donaciinae (see also Poales: K&ouml;lsch &amp; Pedersen 2008: much discussion on the age and evolution of the group). Interestingly, Enterobacteriaceae near <i>Buchnera</i> are believed to produce the material that makes up the cocoon that characterises Donaciinae, a group that is also noted for the ability of the larvae to grow under water (K&ouml;lsch &amp; Pedersen 2010).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><u>Genes &amp; Genomes.</u> A genome duplication in <i>Nuphar</i> is estimated to have occurred (76.8-)72.8(-67.9) m.y.a. (Vanneste et al. 2014b).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Chemistry, Morphology, etc.</b> The root endodermis has a Casparian strip. There are sometimes sclerenchymatous diaphragms in the pith. The vasculature of the stem is exceedingly complex, especially at the node, with peduncular complexes forming internally, however, basic stem structure is unlike that of monocotyledons; the primary xylem is mesarch (Weidlich 1980 and references). Schneider et al. (2008, 2009) and Schneider and Carlquist (2009) discuss stem tracheids and root vessels, emphasizing the rather arbitrary distinction between vessels and tracheids; Carlquist (2012c) suggested that there were no vessels. The astrosclereids of <i>Nuphar</i> and <i>Nymphaea</i>, at least, have calcium oxalate crystals in the walls (Fink 1991). Stipules may be adaxial and bicarinate or paired and lateral. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">In both <i>Nuphar</i> and <i>Nymphaea</i> flowers and even branches may replace leaves in the genetic spiral (e.g. Cutter 1957a, b; Gro&szlig; et al. 2006). Cutter (1957b) noted that the leaf apparently subtending the flower of <i>Nuphar</i> was in fact born on the flower stalk; if a prophyll, it should be noted that it is <u>ab</u>axial in position! For discussion as to whether or not <i>Nuphar</i> has bracts, see Schneider et al. (2003).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Flower parts are generally whorled (see Endress &amp; Doyle 2015 and references). Yoo et al. (2010) discuss the evolutionary/developmental relationship between sepals and petals; see also Doyle and Endress (2011), who suggest that <i>Nuphar</i> has both tepals and petals. Schneider (1976) and Moseley and Uhl (1985) note that the vascular supply to perianth and androecial members consists of two radially associated bundles. In <i>Euryale</i> the filaments are quite slender and are basally adnate to the staminodes; it is unclear if it has free nuclear endosperm (Floyd &amp; Friedman 2001 - see also Kanna 1964, 1967 for endosperm development in the family). Weberling (1989) suggested that in at least some Nymphaeaceae the individual carpels were free laterally, if adnate to the central axis inside and to "hypanthial" tissue outside (see also von Balthazar et al. 2008). The ovules of <i>Victoria</i> and <i>Euryale</i> are massive affairs (Zini et al. 2016). Zhou and Fu (2008) found that at anthesis, but not before or after, the micropyle of <i>Nuphar</i> was bistomal, not endostomal. Weberling (1989) also described how in <i>Nuphar</i> axial tissue separates from the gynoecium when the fruits are ripe, so exposing the basically free carpels; if this is correct (but it seems rather unlikely), its gynoecium  would be very similar to that of other Nymphaeaceae; Padgett (2007) described dehiscence as being along lines in the  septal and ovarian walls where aerenchymatous tissue had developed. The seedling axis of some species of <i>Nymphaea</i> have a lateral projection.</p> 

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Some
information is taken from Schneider and Williamson (1993: general); see Moseley (1958) for stamen morphology, Yao et al. (2004), M. L. Taylor et al. (2012, 2013) and Coiro and Lumaga (2013), all pollen morphology, for ovules, Zini et al. (2014b) and Shamrov (1998: <i>Nuphar</i>), Floyd and Friedman (2001)  endosperm development,  Povilus et al. (2015: embryology and endosperm), Takhtajan (1988) and Losada et al. (2014) ovules and seeds, Khanna (1964, 1967) embryology (8-nucleate embryo sacs...), Cook (1909) embryology, and Tillich (1990) seedling morphology. For <i>Nuphar</i>, see  Padgett (2007).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Phylogeny.</b>  <i>Nymphaea</i> s. str. was monophyletic in a phylogenetic analysis of vegetative characters, but without much support (D. W. Taylor 2008). Y.-L. Liu et al. (2005) provide an ITS phylogeny of the family, but with some rather surprising relationships - [<i>Nuphar</i> [<i>Cabomba</i> + <i>Brasenia</i>] [<i>Nymphaea</i> [<i>Euryale</i> + <i>Victoria</i>]]]. <i>Nelumbo</i>, which was included in the analysis, did at least stay outside this clade... For a  phylogeny of <i>Nymphaea</i>, see Borsch et al. (2007, 2012); the genus definitely includes the wind-pollinated and usually apetalous <i>Ondinea</i>, but some relationships lacked much support, e.g. the position of [<i>Euryale</i> + <i>Victoria</i>] as sister to <i>Nymphaea</i> s.l.. However, in some studies the spiny <i>Victoria</i> and <i>Euryale</i> are embedded in <i>Nymphaea</i> s.l. (L&ouml;hne et al. 2007, 2009; Borsch et al. 2008; c.f. Friis et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>Classification.</b> A broad circumscription for <i>Nymphaea</i> seems the best solution.</p>
